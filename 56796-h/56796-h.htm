<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>This book contains more than one thousand
facts, many of which are not generally known
to the average person; but all of them are of
interest to humankind, and a knowledge of
many of them is essential.</p>

<p>The author has used the simplest English,
and has avoided, as far as possible, all technical
or scientific terms. He has endeavored not
to fall into the common error of making his
explanations harder to understand than the
subjects treated.</p>

<p>This book is not intended for the scientist,
nor does it claim to be exhaustive.</p>

<p>In the space of a few hundred pages the
writer has presented the thousand or more
things which are really worth knowing, and
which are usually described at unprofitable
length and without that simplicity of expression
so essential to clearness.</p>

<p><b>Acetylene Gas.</b>&mdash;Acetylene gas is used
largely for the search-lamps on automobiles.
It is composed of carbon and hydrogen.</p>


<p><b>Adventists.</b>&mdash;A religious sect whose members
believe that the second coming of Christ
is near at hand. There are over 100,000 communicants
and ministers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Æolian Harp.</b>&mdash;This instrument was invented
in the 17th century and was named
after Æolus, the god of the winds. It is of
the simplest construction, and its music is
produced by the vibration of the strings automatically
moved by the winds. In construction
it is a rectangular box of thin boards
of a few inches in depth and width and of
sufficient length to extend across a window so
that the breeze may pass through it. The
strings are stretched lengthwise across the
top of the box, and may be tuned by increasing
or decreasing their tension.</p>


<p><b>Age.</b>&mdash;About 50 per cent. of the persons living
in the United States are under 20 years of
age, 45 per cent. from 20 to 60 years, and 5
per cent. over 60 years, the average age being
about 25 years. This average seems low, and
is due largely to infant mortality. If the percentage
was taken excluding those under 15
years of age it would be very much higher.</p>


<p><b>Agricultural Implement Industry.</b>&mdash;Capital
invested, about $260,000,000, and an annual
output of about $150,000,000. About 60,000
people are employed.</p>


<p><b>Alaska.</b>&mdash;Alaska is the only territory of the
United States, the Hawaiian Islands, Porto
Rico, and the Philippines being known as Possessions.
It has an area of over 590,000 square
miles, and a population of about 65,000. Its
climate is semipolar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Algebra.</b>&mdash;The discoverer or the first user
of algebra is unknown. It is said that Diophantus
wrote it in 170 A. D., and he may
have been its inventor. It was brought into
Spain in about 900. Its signs are said to have
been used first in 1544, but algebra did not
come into common use until 1590. Descartes
applied algebra to geometry in 1637.</p>


<p><b>Almanacs.</b>&mdash;The word "almanac" is of
Saxon origin, and probably the first almanac
was published in 1470, and the first in English
in 1673.</p>


<p><b>Amazons.</b>&mdash;An ancient body of warlike
women, ruled by a queen, who allowed no
man to live with them. They were opposed
to marriage and resolved to form a female
state. They burned off their right breasts
that they might better use the bow and javelin.
This custom is the origin of the name
"Amazons" or "breastless ones."</p>


<p><b>Apostles' Creed.</b>&mdash;Considered by most Biblical
students as the earliest form of Christian
creed. It is attributed directly to the Apostles.
It is doubtless the formula of belief that
existed in all the early Latin churches. It was
made a part of public worship of the Christian
church at Antioch, and introduced into the
Roman Catholic Church in the eleventh century,
and subsequently into the Church of
England.</p>


<p><b>April Fool's Day.</b>&mdash;Its origin is unknown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
but it is supposed to follow an ancient pageant
custom of playing tricks on the first day of
April.</p>


<p><b>Arbor Day.</b>&mdash;A few years ago the United
States and Canada officially set apart one day
in the year for the planting of trees, shrubs,
etc. It was the intention to have this day
observed chiefly by the children of the public
schools. Its observance has resulted in the
planting of millions of trees.</p>


<p><b>Arithmetic.</b>&mdash;While the inventor or discoverer
of arithmetic is unknown, it is said that
it was brought from Egypt into Greece in 600
B. C. Euclid is the author of the oldest treatise
upon arithmetic and wrote it about 300 B.
C. The arithmetic of decimals began in 1482,
and the first arithmetic in English was printed
in 1522.</p>


<p><b>Artesian Wells.</b>&mdash;An artesian well is one
made by boring perpendicularly into the
earth. The oldest known well of this kind
was sunk in Europe in 1126. Probably the
most famous one is near Paris, which was
bored in 1833, bringing water from a depth of
1792 feet. From this well 516 gallons of water
flow per minute. In Missouri there is one well
2197 feet deep, and another nearly 4000 feet
deep. The invention of the artesian well is
undoubtedly due to the Chinese.</p>


<p><b>Artificial Ice.</b>&mdash;The artificial manufacture of
ice is of somewhat recent origin, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
are over 2,000 ice-making plants in the United
States, exclusive of those used by breweries,
packers, and others for the making of their
own ice. Artificial ice-making showed an increase
of 81 per cent. during the last few
years.</p>


<p><b>Atlantic Cable.</b>&mdash;The original or, rather, the
first permanent cable, was laid in July, 1866,
connecting Ireland with Newfoundland; but
an earlier cable was laid between the foregoing
points, which was lost in construction.
This lost cable, however, was recovered and
completed.</p>

<p>In 1868 a cable was laid from France to
Duxbury, Mass. In 1873 the fourth Atlantic
cable connected Ireland and Trinity Bay, New
Foundland. Several cables have been subsequently
laid, and are maintained.</p>

<p>Considerable difficulty was experienced in
obtaining the right kind, and a sufficient current,
of electricity, which would carry the
message several thousand miles under water,
and not pass from the cable into the water itself.</p>

<p>Two keys are used, which, when depressed,
transmit respectively positive and negative
currents coming from the connected batteries.
The current does not pass directly into the
cable, but enters what is known as a condenser,
and from there reaches the wire itself.
This increases the force of the current and
overcomes interfering earth currents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Originally the messages were received by
a reflecting galvanometer. Upon the magnet
of this instrument was placed a small curved
mirror, and in front of it was a lighted lamp
behind a frame with a vertical slit. The light
from the lamp passed through the slit and fell
upon the surface of the mirror. The flashes
of light moving with the movements of the
suspended needle, indicated the message sent.
Because of the delicacy of the instrument, it
was difficult to translate the telegraphic code.
The system has been entirely superseded by
the use of the syphon galvanometer. This
needle is affected by the currents, and moves
in response to the opening and closing of the
telegraphic key. It consists of a small hollow
needle, which swings between two fixed magnets.
A very soluble analine ink is allowed
to flow through the tube. The mouth of this
tube is suspended a very small fraction above
a strip or roll of white paper, which moves
automatically. The vibration or movements
of the needle allow the ink to flow in irregular
lines or curves upon the moving paper. These
irregularities or curves indicate letters, which
are easily read by the receiving operator.</p>

<p>Cable dispatches now are recorded, when
formerly they had to be read as they were
seen, with the impossibility of retaining an
automatic record of them.</p>

<p>Professor Morse, the inventor of telegraphy,
may be considered the inventor of the cable,
although he had little to do with its mechani<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>cal
construction. To Mr. Cyrus W. Field
must be given much of the credit, for its accomplishment
was largely due to his foresight
and energy.</p>

<p>The cable consists of several copper wires
imbedded in gutta percha or similar substance,
which is one of the best nonconductors of
electricity. The cable, with its several wires
and coverings or insulation, has a circumference
equal to that of the old-fashioned three-cent
piece. Several wires are imbedded into
the insulation, so as to insure better connection.</p>

<p>The cable is laid by steamers built for the
purpose. They travel over a charted route,
and, unscientifically speaking, throw the cable
overboard. Of course, no cable could be constructed
of a length that would reach across
the ocean. New pieces are, therefore, spliced
in as conditions require. If the sea is too
rough for the laying of the cable, the end is
buoyed and picked up when the weather
changes. The cable lies upon the bottom of
the ocean, and, as the bottom of the ocean
is as irregular as the surface of the earth, with
its mountains, plateaus, and valleys, there is
always danger of the cable being broken or
injured, although there is, of course, absolute
quiet at the bottom of the ocean. Then, many
feet, or even a mile, of cable may be stretched
between two projecting points, and the strain
may part it in time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>The process of locating a break or injury
is very interesting. The cable fails to work.
The operator stationed at either end discharges
electricity into the cable, and, although
it does not reach the other side, he
can, by a delicate instrument, locate approximately
the place of parting or where injury
has occurred. The repair steamer sails for
the place. With grappling irons it brings the
cable to the surface; but as the location of the
break cannot be determined accurately, the
electrician on board must determine which
way to sail to locate the place of the trouble.
He attaches the cable to a battery on board,
and opens connection with the land. If the
break, for example, is between him and
Europe, the European operator will not respond,
but he will receive a reply from the
American operator. He then directs the vessel's
course towards Europe. The cable,
when it is taken on board, is run on pulley
wheels, one in the bow and one in the stern
of the vessel, and the vessel sails slowly under
the cable. As the vessel is two or three
hundred feet long, several hundred feet of
cable will be exposed. The cable is watched
carefully, and the break or injury will be
easily located. When it is, the operator connects
the cable with the batteries, and then
telegraphs in the direction opposite to that
from which he received a reply. If his message
goes through, the receiving operator will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
respond. If a reply comes, he knows he has
located the break; if no reply is received, there
must be other breaks in the same direction.
The break is repaired, and the steamer sails
on until it finds another break or injury. I
have attempted to explain this in the simplest
words. It is obvious that a scientific explanation
would be unintelligible to the average
reader.</p>


<p><b>Atmosphere.</b>&mdash;While accurate figures are
impossible, and while astronomers somewhat
differ, it is generally conceded that the earth's
atmosphere extends from the surface to an altitude
of about 40 miles. It is theoretically
or scientifically accepted that the density of
the atmosphere at only a few miles from the
surface of the earth is not sufficient to support
life.</p>


<p><b>Aurora Borealis.</b>&mdash;Until electricity was discovered,
the origin of the aurora borealis was
unknown, and was supposed to be of supernatural
origin. Even to-day its exact composition
or source is more or less of a mystery,
but it is generally supposed that it is caused
by the recomposition of positive and negative
electricity. It exists only in the regions of
the poles, although its light is seen to a moderate
degree over the greater part of the earth.</p>


<p><b>Automobiles.</b>&mdash;All vehicles used on the common
highway, and propelled by any mechanical
power, whether it be by steam, gasoline,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
or electricity, are known as automobiles or
motor cars, and are frequently called "autos"
for short. The invention of the automobile is
very recent, although steam-propelled carriages
were in existence more than 50 years
ago. Exceeding a million are in daily use in
the United States.</p>


<p><b>Bank of England.</b>&mdash;Established in the city
of London in 1694. Although a private institution,
it is under Government control, and
constitutes the Treasury of the Empire, England
having no national treasury like that of
the United States. It is managed by a governor,
deputy-governor, and twenty-four directors.</p>


<p><b>Bastile.</b>&mdash;The name given to a French
prison, built between 1370 and 1383, originally
as a fortress, but later used as a regular prison.
It was destroyed by a mob in 1789. It was
the seat of the terrible cruelties practiced in
the early days.</p>


<p><b>Bayreuth Festival.</b>&mdash;A musical festival held
at the National Theatre in Bayreuth, Bavaria,
which was built for the performance of the
works of Wagner. The foundation stone of
the building was laid in 1872, and Wagner
himself opened the theatre in 1876 with a
grand production of the "Nibelungen Trilogy."</p>


<p><b>Bible.</b>&mdash;Between the eighth and tenth cen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>turies
parts of the Bible were translated into
Anglo-Saxon, and in 1290 appeared an English
version of the Psalms. In 1380 the New
Testament was finished, and a little later the
Old Testament was fully translated. The so-called
King James Bible was published in
1610, and remained in common use until the
present revisions were made.</p>

<p><b>Blind.</b>&mdash;In the United States there are
about 65,000 blind persons, a little more than
half of whom are totally blind. Of this number
about 37,000 are males, and about 28,000
females.</p>


<p><b>Blood-heat.</b>&mdash;The normal temperature of
man is about 98-1/2° Fahrenheit. This temperature
is maintained with a variation of not more
than two degrees, whether one lives on the
Equator or in the Arctic regions. Any great
deviation is likely to prove fatal. Animals
have about the same temperature as man,
while the blood of birds is from eight to ten
degrees warmer. Reptiles, fishes, and all invertebrates
maintain temperatures about the
same as that of their environment.</p>


<p><b>Blue-Grass Region.</b>&mdash;An undulating plateau
in the north-central part of Kentucky, covering
about 10,000 square miles, is known as the
Blue-Grass Region. The underlying rock for
150 or more feet is blue limestone, very rich
in phosphate of lime. This rock crumbles on
exposure to the air and enriches the soil. Tobacco
and hemp have two crops a year and
grow to a great height. Meadow grass grows
continuously. The Blue-Grass Region for
many years has been the centre of the blooded
stock of America.</p>

<p><b>Boxers.</b>&mdash;A Chinese secret society supposed
to be semireligious and semipatriotic. The
Boxers originally believed that they were immune
from death or physical injury, and that
they could, with safety, attack any foreign
foe.</p>


<p><b>Brain.</b>&mdash;As the action of the brain has not,
as yet, been seen by man, no one, at the present
day, knows just what it is, beyond its
merely physiological or mechanical substance.
It is said that the brain of the normal man
contains over 300,000,000 cells, and that about
3,000 are destroyed every minute. If this is
the case, then a new brain appears once in 60
days. The normal brain has a volume of
from 58 to 105 cubic inches. The brain of the
Anglo-Saxon and German, and of other civilized
nations, averages the larger number,
while the negro brain occupies a space of
about 96 cubic inches, and some Australian
natives have brains of only about 58 cubic
inches. The male brain is about ten per cent.
heavier or larger than that of the female.
The most intelligent animals have only about
16 ounces of brains. The size of the brain,
if it is not below normal, does not appear to
influence the intellectuality of its possessor.
Men with small brains may have larger mind
capacity than some of those possessing brains
weighing several ounces more. It would appear,
then, that the size of the brain, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
it be unusually small, has little to do with its
quality.</p>


<p><b>Bread.</b>&mdash;It is said that the Chinese were the
first bread makers, and that they made bread
from wheat and rice as early as 1998 B. C.
Probably the first bread made from yeast was
baked in England in about 1634. Aërated
bread, which rises from carbolic acid gas injected
into the dough, became somewhat common
in 1857, but practically all bread, bakery-made
or home-made, owes its leavening to
yeast or baking powder.</p>


<p><b>Breakfast Foods.</b>&mdash;Breakfast foods in the
main are composed of either corn, wheat, or
oat products, a few being made of barley,
starch, and tapioca. They are sold under
trade names, and most of them need no cooking
by the consumer, as they were properly
cooked at the mill. Usually they are made
of only one grain, and to some of them is
added a small quantity of salt. Most of them
are pure products and are unadulterated, but
few, if any of them, are any better than the
grain sold in bulk, which can be purchased
for about 4 cents per pound.</p>


<p><b>Brook Farm.</b>&mdash;A famous socialistic community,
originated by George Ripley and
others in 1841 and located near West Roxbury,
Massachusetts. The estate consisted of
two hundred acres, and a company of edu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>cated
men and women settled here to work
out an experiment, in which each person performed
a certain share of necessary manual
labor. The enterprise was abandoned as an
utter failure in 1846. Among the persons connected
with the movement were George Ripley,
Charles A. Dana, Ralph Waldo Emerson,
Nathaniel Hawthorne, George William Curtis,
Theodore Parker, Margaret Fuller, and Dr.
Channing.</p>


<p class="ph3">Calculating Interest</p>

<p>To find the interest on any sum, at any rate
per cent., and for any length of time: 1st.
Multiply the principal by the rate per cent.,
expressed in hundredths; this will give the
interest for one year. 2nd. Find the number
of days remaining by consulting the calendar;
and multiply the principal by as many hundredths
as there are days, and for 3 per cent.,
divide the product by 120; for 4 per cent.,
divide by 90; for 5 per cent., divide by 72; for
6 per cent., divide by 60; for 7 per cent., divide
by 52; for 8 per cent., divide by 45; for 9 per
cent., divide by 40; for 10 per cent., divide by
36; and for 12 per cent., divide by 30. This
will give the interest for the days. 3rd. Add
the two items of interest, and the sum will
be the entire interest.</p>

<p>To find the number of days from any day
of any one month to the same day of any
other month.</p>

<p><b>Canals.</b>&mdash;The Suez Canal is 90 miles long
with a depth of 35 feet, and is 108 feet wide
at the bottom. It cost $100,000,000. The
Manchester Canal, between Manchester and
Liverpool, is 35-1/2 miles long, with a depth of
28 feet, and 120 feet wide at the bottom. It
cost $85,000,000. The canal connecting the
Baltic and North Seas is 61 miles long, 29-1/2
feet deep, and has a bottom width of 72 feet.
It cost $40,000,000. The Panama Canal,
which is not yet completed, will be about 50
miles in length, with a width of 300 feet, and
a minimum depth of 41 feet. The United
States Government paid $50,000,000 to the new
French Canal Company and the Republic of
Panama, for property rights and franchises,
and the total cost of the canal will not be far
from $375,000,000. At the present time nearly
50,000 men are at work upon the canal, and
the official opening is announced for January<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>

<p><b>Capitol at Washington.</b>&mdash;The Capitol is situated
in latitude 38° 53´ 20´´.4 north and longitude
77° 00´ 35´´.7 west from Greenwich. It
fronts east, and stands on a plateau eighty-eight
feet above the level of the Potomac.
The entire length of the building from north
to south is 751 feet 4 inches, and its greatest
dimension from east to west 350 feet. The
area covered by the building is 153,112 square
feet. The dome of the original central building
was constructed of wood, covered with
copper. This was replaced in 1856 by the
present structure of cast iron. The entire
weight of iron used is 8,909,200 pounds. The
dome is crowned by a bronze statue of Freedom,
which is nineteen feet, six inches, high
and weighs 14,985 pounds. The height of the
dome above the base line of the east front is
287 feet 5 inches. The height from the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of the balustrade of the building is 217 feet
11 inches. The greatest diameter at the base
is 135 feet 5 inches. The rotunda is 97 feet
6 inches in diameter, and its height from the
floor to the top of the canopy is 217 feet 3
inches. The Senate Chamber is 113 feet 3
inches in length, 83 feet 3 inches in width,
and 36 feet in height. The galleries will
accommodate 1,000 persons. The Representatives'
Hall is 139 feet in length, by 93 feet
in width, and 36 feet in height. The room now
occupied by the Supreme Court was, until
1859, the Senate Chamber. Previous to that
time the court occupied the room immediately
beneath, now used as a law library.</p>


<p><b>Celluloid.</b>&mdash;Celluloid, from which many
toilet articles and imitations of ivory are made,
is composed from the cellulose found in cotton
cloth or raw cotton. It is treated with a solution
of nitric acid which forms it into a pulp
very much like paper pulp. It is then washed
with water, which removes most of the acid.
It is partially hardened and camphor gum
mixed with it, when it is rolled into sheets
and thoroughly dried. In order to manipulate
it, it is softened by steam and then hardened
by drying. Celluloid is very inflammable.
Wearers of celluloid combs and other
ornaments should not expose themselves to
fire.</p>


<p><b>Certified Checks.</b>&mdash;A personal check becomes
certified when across it is written "cer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>tified,"
with the name of the bank and the
signature of the cashier or other official. The
bank, then, becomes liable for the amount of
the check. If the maker of a check has his
check certified, he is jointly responsible with
the bank for its payment, but if the receiver
of the check has it certified, the maker of the
check is released from all responsibility.</p>

<p><b>Chess.</b>&mdash;Chess is one of the oldest, and probably
the most scientific, game known. Its
origin is mysterious. It was mentioned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Oriental literature about 2000 B. C. It was
originally played in India, Persia, and Arabia,
and subsequently was known in Spain and
Western Europe. It is said that it was invented
in order to teach the art of war.</p>


<p><b>Christmas.</b>&mdash;A festival commemorating the
birth of Christ. Said to have been observed
as early as 98. Some of the early Christians
celebrated the event in May; others in April
and in June. In the fifth century, it was generally
observed on the 25th of December.</p>


<p><b>Circulation of the Blood.</b>&mdash;Although even
the savage had seen and spilled blood, the
circulation of the blood, and the part that it
plays in the human machine, was not discovered
until about 1616, by the English physiologist,
William Harvey.</p>


<p><b>Climate and Temperature.</b>&mdash;Climatic conditions
are dependent upon heat, moisture, and
altitude. The greatest heat is at the equator
and diminishes as one approaches either pole,
but a place of high altitude near the equator
may be cooler than another farther removed
from it and occupying a shut-in or low position.
It is warm at times, even near the poles.
The climate is also affected by the winds, and
very greatly by the ocean, and especially by
ocean currents. Take England, for example:
it is considerably further north than Boston
or New York City, and yet its climate is much
warmer or milder, due to its proximity to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Gulf Stream. Land near the ocean is likely
to be cooler in summer on account of its prevailing
winds, and warmer in winter because
a large body of water reduces the cold. It is
well-known that towns on the seashore do not
suffer from extreme cold as much as do those
in the same latitude further inland. The altitude
has much to do with climate. Even in
the warmest countries, where the heat is intense,
the tops of high mountains are clothed
with snow. Forests, by their shade, reduce
the temperature.</p>


<p><b>Coal Industry.</b>&mdash;In the United States the
coal fields have an area of exceeding 160,000
square miles, but it is supposed that there are
at least 310,000 square miles which contain
coal. The estimated quantity of the available
coal is exceeding 3,000,000,000,000 tons.</p>


<p><b>Cocoa Industry.</b>&mdash;The world produces about
530,000,000 pounds of cocoa annually. The
United States consumes about 130,000,000
pounds; Germany about 112,000,000; France
about 60,000,000; England about 56,000,000;
the total consumption being about 507,000,000.</p>


<p><b>Coffee Industry.</b>&mdash;Brazil, about 1,300,000,000,
Central America, about 201,000,000, Venezuela,
about 97,000,000, other South American
countries about 78,000,000, Hayti and Santo
Domingo, about 84,000,000, Mexico, about 43,000,000,
Porto Rico, about 34,000,000, Jamaica,
about 10,000,000; a total of nearly 2,000,000,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>000
pounds annually. The United States consumes
about 881,000,000 pounds a year.</p>


<p><b>Coin.</b>&mdash;Money, in the form of metallic coins,
probably superseded all other legal tenders.
The first record of the coining of silver was
in 869 B. C., and it was made in Rome as
early as 269 B. C., and in Great Britain 25
years before the Christian Era. Gold was first
coined in England in 1087. Copper money
was introduced by James I of England in 1620.
The United States mint began to coin money
in 1793.</p>


<p><b>Colosseum.</b>&mdash;The building of the Colosseum
at Rome began in A. D. 80. It covers about
five acres of ground, and has a seating capacity
for nearly 90,000 persons. It was built
in the form of an oval, with a diameter varying
from 312 to 515 feet, the height being
from 160 to 180 feet. In its arena, the gladiators
fought among themselves and with wild
beasts. At its dedication by Titus, 5,000 wild
beasts were killed, and the celebration lasted
for nearly a hundred days. Occasionally the
arena was flooded with water, and sea fights
took place.</p>


<p><b>Comets.</b>&mdash;Comets are supposed to be made
up of an innumerable number of meteors, with
millions of miles of burning gas. They have
regular orbits, but they have not been fully
established and are more or less eccentric.
They are not supposed to shine by their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
light, but to obtain it by reflection. The orbit
of comets was discovered by Hadley in 1682,
who predicted their return. Sometimes the
head and tail part, and remain so. Their number
is unknown, but there are supposed to be
thousands of them. The comet formerly was
looked upon as a source of danger, and it was
supposed that the near approach of one of
them would destroy the earth or any other
celestial body. Recent research, however, indicates
that comets have not sufficient density
to cause damage, although they might affect
the atmosphere. The principal thing to be
feared, however, if there is any danger, is that
the envelopment of the earth by the comet's
gas would destroy life, but most astronomers
have agreed that the atmosphere of the earth
would be sufficient protection. So far as is
known, no comet has ever caused any injury,
and as they have existed from time immemorial,
there would appear to be no reason for
alarm.</p>

<p><b>Communism and Socialism.</b>&mdash;Communism
is a doctrine which would abolish individual
rights, including the ownership of property.
It began in England and France, but has
never made any great progress. Socialism is
allied to Communism, but is a milder form.
It does not suggest the abolition of individual
rights, but to make all rights subordinate to
the good of the people. An acceptable definition
of either has never been presented, and
members of both parties differ materially. Socialism,
however, has grown very rapidly, and
the Socialistic Party in the United States is
frequently successful. Some of our ablest
scholars and investigators believe that Socialism
will become prevalent, and that in it
is vested many of the solutions to our economic
problems.</p>

<p><b>Compass.</b>&mdash;The compass was unknown to
civilization until the close of the twelfth century,
but there appears to be good authority
for the statement that it was used in China
centuries before the European nations were
aware of its power. The compass consists of
a piece of steel, usually in the form of a needle,
which has been magnetized so as to maintain
its magnetism indefinitely. It is set on a piece
of cork or rests lightly on a pivot, and if allowed
to move freely, it will point towards the
North Magnetic Pole, the opposite end of the
needle indicating the South Magnetic Pole.
The needle does not point to the Geographical
Pole, but to the North Magnetic Pole, which
is some degrees south of the former. The
earth is a magnet, and the magnetic needle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
is influenced by the currents of the earth, and,
therefore, points to the North under the influence
of these currents. No compass is absolutely
correct, for the needle does not always
point to the North with a full degree of
accuracy. It is subject to variations, which
are caused by outside influences, like the presence
of metallic substances. Without the
compass, navigation would be unsafe, if not
impossible, for no mariner, without it, would
know the direction he is sailing in at night
or during a cloudy day.</p>


<p><b>Corsets.</b>&mdash;The corset, or something similar
to what is now worn, appeared in France and
Germany in the 13th century, and a 100 years
later was introduced into England. The cloth
was interwoven with rods of whalebone or
steel, but when the price of whalebone increased,
other stiffening rods were used.</p>


<p><b>Cosmetics.</b>&mdash;Vaseline, cold cream, and glycerine
are perfectly safe to use, although the
latter irritates some skins. Most of the cosmetics
upon the market, including many of
those advertised to produce a good complexion,
are practically worthless, and undoubtedly
quite a number of them contain poisonous
drugs and chemicals. The writer does not recall
a cosmetic which contains any virtue not
found in cold cream, vaseline, or glycerine.
Most cosmetics are made of cold cream or
vaseline, highly perfumed, and are claimed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
possess special virtues. The only way to obtain
a good complexion is to keep the skin in
a healthy state by constant bathing and by
massage, either with the hands or with a
towel, with a moderate use of cold cream or
other similar article. Nothing has ever been
discovered which will restore the bloom of
youth, and all articles advertised for that purpose
are practically worthless. If they contain
any "bloom," it is in the form of a dye
or color. No one should use any concoction
or salve other than cold cream, vaseline, glycerine,
or an almond preparation, without the
advice of a physician.</p>


<p><b>Cost of the British Royal Family.</b>&mdash;The
annuities paid by the British people to the
Royal family for its support are as follows:
The King and Queen, $2,350,000; Queen Alexandra,
$350,000; Princess Christian, $30,000;
Princess Louise (Duchess of Argyll), $30,000;
Duke of Connaught, $125,000; Duchess of
Edinburgh, $30,000; Princess Beatrice, $30,000;
Duchess of Albany, $30,000; Duchess of
Mecklenburg-Strelitz, $15,000; Trustees for
King Edward VII's Daughters, $90,000; total,
$2,790,000. The King also receives the revenues
of the Duchy of Lancaster. During recent
years these have amounted to about
$350,000 per annum. The Prince of Wales
has an income also from the revenues of the
Duchy of Cornwall, amounting to about $500,000
per annum. When the Royal children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
marry dowries are usually provided for them.
The last of the children of the late Queen
Victoria to marry, Princess Beatrice, received
$150,000 as dowry from the British people by
Parliamentary grant.</p>


<p><b>Cotton Gin.</b>&mdash;One of the three or four greatest
inventions of civilization. It was invented
by Eli Whitney in 1793. The machine separates
the cotton wool from the seed, and automatically
cleans it with great rapidity. Previously,
the work was done by hand, a most
tedious process.</p>


<p><b>Cotton Industry.</b>&mdash;From 16,000,000 to 17,000,000
bales of cotton are sold each year,
each bale weighing about 490 lbs.</p>


<p><b>Cradle of American Liberty.</b>&mdash;A name given
to Faneuil Hall, in Boston, Massachusetts,
from the fact that many meetings were held
here during Revolutionary days for the purpose
of declaring the citizens' rights and protesting
against the interference of England.</p>


<p><b>Credit Mobilier.</b>&mdash;This consisted of a stock
company, organized in 1863, for the purpose
of constructing public works, including principally
the building of the Union Pacific Railroad.
Without going into the merits of the
case, it may be said that this organization received
much criticism, as it developed that
many of the members of Congress were supposed
to be connected with it. It is said that
some of these members were corrupt and used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
this organization to feather their nest. It
constituted, perhaps, the greatest national
scandal, placing under suspicion, as it did,
many of our so-called statesmen.</p>


<p><b>Crusades.</b>&mdash;The name of wars carried on at
intervals from 1095 to 1270 by the Christian
nations of Europe against the Saracens, for
the purpose of gaining possession of the Holy
Land. There were eight Crusades, and the
soldiers who engaged in them wore a cross
on their breast or right shoulder as a sign of
their religious faith. Hence the name Crusades
from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crux</i>, cross.</p>


<p><b>Crust of the Earth.</b>&mdash;Very little is known of
the interior of the earth, except that it is
supposed to be a molten mass. The aggregate
thickness of the strata or rock-layers, as
far as known, is less than thirty miles.</p>


<p><b>Daguerreotypes.</b>&mdash;Early photography owes
its origin to the discovery of the daguerreotype.
A plate, made of thin copper or other
metal, was covered with a silver preparation.
This was placed directly in the camera, and
there was no method of transfer, as there is
from the ordinary photographic plate, from
which innumerable prints may be taken. It
went out of common use with the invention
of the photographic plates and paper, and with
the discovery of instantaneous photography.
The taking of the daguerreotype required long
exposure, which was decidedly objectionable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and the result was coarse and tame. After
taking, the daguerreotype passed through acid
solutions for the development and permanency
of the picture.</p>


<p><b>Damage by Lightning.</b>&mdash;Statistics vary, but
considerably more than 6,000 buildings are injured
by lightning every year, causing a loss
of about $3,000,000. About 700 people are
killed every year, and more than 800 are injured.
It is said that lightning kills between
4,000 and 5,000 domestic animals a year,
valued at about $130,000.</p>


<p><b>Deaf and Dumb.</b>&mdash;About 90,000 of the inhabitants
of the United States are deaf and
dumb, more than half of that number being
born with this affliction. Of this number
about 47,000 are males, and somewhat over
43,000 females.</p>


<p><b>Deeds.</b>&mdash;A deed is an instrument in writing,
conveying real estate, with or without buildings
upon it, from one party to another. All
deeds should be registered. Printed forms,
to be filled out, are for sale at stationers. It
is better to employ a good lawyer or conveyancer.</p>


<p><b>Dictionaries.</b>&mdash;Probably the first dictionary
was produced in China, and was said to contain
40,000 characters. In the 15th and 16th
centuries, encyclopedias were published. The
first authoritative dictionary was in Latin, and
was translated into eight languages about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
year 1500. Chamber's Encyclopedia was published
in 1728, and Johnson's famous English
dictionary in 1755. Webster's American dictionary
was first issued in 1828.</p>

<p><b>Diving Bells.</b>&mdash;The diving bell is simply
a covering made of metal, which is securely
fastened to a water-proof suit, the diving bell
itself being an enclosure for the head. The
diver dons his suit, the neck of which has a
collar in the form of a screw. The diving
bell is placed over his head and screwed on.
It is connected with a rubber pipe, through
which air is forced by an air pump, the air escaping
through a valve in the belt itself. If
properly constructed and manipulated, one
may remain under water for considerable
time, although he is likely to be uncomfortable
until he becomes used to it. It was invented
about 1715.</p>


<p><b>Drama.</b>&mdash;During 1912, 97 new plays were
presented; 36 were musical comedies; 36 of
the plays were serious or sentimental; 13 were
melodramas; 13 were comedies; one was a
pantomime; two were tragedies, and 14 were
farces.</p>


<p><b>Drugs.</b>&mdash;The safest and best rule to follow
is never to take any drug without the advice
of a physician. Drugs have their place, and
without drugs many diseases would be incurable.
But drugs taken promiscuously derange
the system and give but temporary relief.
Hundreds of thousands of people have contracted
chronic ailments from drug-taking.
Headache powders, cough mixtures, sleeping
potions, and practically all of the advertised
remedies should be strenuously avoided, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>withstanding
that some of them are pure and
would be efficacious if administered intelligently.
Because one particular drug or medicine
benefits a certain person should not be
considered as evidence that it will aid another.
The habit of borrowing prescriptions
is dangerous. The intelligent physician writes
a prescription, which will benefit his patient,
and the same prescription would be of no
benefit, and might be of positive injury, to
another. Many of the testimonials given to
patent medicines are genuine and are written
by honest persons. The effect of many of the
advertised nostrums is to give immediate or
transient relief. They stimulate the system,
and may make it feel better for a short time,
but re-action is likely to set in, and the taker
of them is worse off than he was in the first
place.</p>

<p><b>Dynamite.</b>&mdash;This is one of the strongest explosives,
and is used for blasting, and even
for guns, although it has not, as yet, been successful
for the firing of projectiles. It consists
of infusorial and porcelain earth, mixed
with coal dust and siliceous ashes, saturated
with about three times its weight of nitro-glycerine.
It is of a grayish-brown or reddish
color, damp, and greasy. It has an explosive
power nearly eight times greater than
that of gun powder. It is dangerous to make,
because the nitro-glycerine which it contains
will explode if not handled carefully.</p>

<p>The distance from the surface of the earth
to its center is estimated to be 20,926,202
feet; or about 3,963, miles; and the distance
from the poles to the center of the earth is
20,854,895 feet, or about 3,951 miles. One degree
of latitude at the equator is about 68.7
miles, and at the poles about 69-1/2 miles.</p>

<p>The circumference at the equator measures
24,902 statute miles.</p>

<p>The total area of the earth is 196,940,400
statute square miles, and its volume is 259,880
million cubic miles.</p>

<p>The land area of the earth covers 54,807,420
square miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The ocean, including the inland seas, covers
142,132,980 square miles, or about 72 per cent.
of the total surface of the earth.</p>

<p>The Arctic Ocean, including Hudson Bay,
contains 5,785,000 square miles; the Atlantic
Ocean, 34,301,400 square miles; the Indian
Ocean, 28,615,000 square miles; the Pacific
Ocean, 67,699,630 square miles; and the Antarctic
Ocean, 5,731,350 square miles.</p>

<p>The mean height of the land has been estimated
at 2,440 feet, and the mean depth of
the sea 11,470 feet. The highest mountain
(Mt. Everest) is 29,000 feet high, and the
greatest depth of the ocean is supposed to be
31,614 feet.</p>

<p>The North American continent has an area
of 6,446,000 square miles, with exceeding
115,000,000 inhabitants, or a little less than
18 to the square mile.</p>

<p>The South American continent has an area
of 6,837,000 square miles, with over 45,000,000
inhabitants, or about 6-1/2 per square mile.</p>

<p>Europe has an area of about 3,555,000
square miles, with a population of somewhat
less than 400,000,000, or about 107 per square
mile.</p>

<p>Africa has an area of 11,514,000 square
miles, and a population of about 127,000,000,
or 11 to the square mile.</p>

<p>Asia has an area of 14,710,000 square miles,
with a population estimated at about 850,000,000,
or a little less than 58 to the square mile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Australia, New Zealand, and contingent islands,
have an area of 3,288,000 square miles,
with a population of exceeding 5,200,000, or
about 27 to the square mile.</p>

<p>It is estimated that the surface of the earth
is divided into somewhat more than 28,000,000
square miles of fertile soil, about 14,000,000
square miles of steppe, a little more than
4,000,000 square miles of desert, with the polar
regions occupying nearly 5,000,000 square
miles of land, most of which is covered with
ice.</p>

<p>At the time of Emperor Augustus, there
were said to be between 54,000,000 and 55,000,000
people upon the earth, but as the earth
undoubtedly supported millions of inhabitants
unknown to civilization, these figures are of
little consequence.</p>

<p>The greatest measured depth of the Atlantic
Ocean is a little over 27,000 feet; a depth
of 30,000 feet has been found in the Pacific
Ocean; 18,582 feet in the Indian Ocean; and
25,200 feet in the Southern Ocean. Soundings
in the Arctic Ocean have failed to find
a depth exceeding 9,000 feet.</p>


<p><b>Earthquakes.</b>&mdash;The earthquake is caused,
undoubtedly, by the cooling of the earth. The
interior of the earth is a molten mass of fire
and is slowly cooling. As it cools, it contracts,
and if the contraction is near the surface
of the earth, the surface is rocked and
crevices may open, doing considerable dam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>age,
although most earthquakes cause but
slight shocks and injure no one. Earthquakes
appear principally in or near the tropics, but
are occasionally felt all over the temperature
zones. Earthquakes appear to have belts, and
there is little to be feared from them outside
of these territories.</p>


<p class="ph3">Earthquake Areas of the Earth</p>

<p>Major de Montessus de Balore has compiled
a catalogue of 130,000 shocks, and this indicates
with scientific accuracy how the symptoms
of seismic activity are manifested. The
period of observation includes generally the
last fifty years; but there is no reason to suppose
that a longer time would materially affect
the proportionate numbers.</p>

<p>The most shaken countries of the world are
Italy, Japan, Greece, South America (the Pa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>cific
coast), Java, Sicily, and Asia Minor. The
lands most free from these convulsions are
Africa, Australia, Russia, Siberia, Scandinavia,
and Canada. As a rule, where earthquakes
are most frequent they are most severe.
But to this general statement there are
exceptions&mdash;Indian shocks, though less numerous,
being often very disastrous. Loss of
life in many cases depends, however, on density
of population rather than on the intensity
of the earth movement. Numerically, also,
France has registered more seismic tremors
than Spain and Portugal, but France in historic
times has experienced no earthquake disaster
approaching the havoc wrought by the
one calamity at Lisbon.</p>


<p><b>Electrical and Other Beautifiers.</b>&mdash;So far as
is known to the writer, none of these contrivances
or concoctions possess any merit,
other than what may be obtained by ordinary
massage or rubbing. Electricity, as a
medicinal agent, is rapidly going out of use,
as it has been proved that it has very little
effect, except in special cases. The reader is
advised against the purchase of any electrical
appliance for beautifying or other purposes
without the advice of a physician.</p>


<p><b>Electricity.</b>&mdash;This peculiar and all-powerful
energy has never been analyzed, and no one
knows exactly what it is. It is produced by
friction, either mechanically or by chemicals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
It is transmitted through wires or other metallic
conductors. Electricity is usually produced
mechanically by what is known as the
dynamo, but can be made chemically by the
use of galvanic batteries. The former, however,
is much more economical. Electricity
and magnetism are closely allied, and yet they
are commercially different.</p>


<p><b>Embezzlement.</b>&mdash;From 1896 to 1911 the total
embezzlement in the United States
amounted to nearly $164,000,000, the majority
of embezzlers stealing the money for gambling
in stocks, and not on account of increased
personal expenses or desire to live beyond
their means.</p>


<p class="ph3">Errors of History</p>

<p>The following list of "Curious Errors of
History" is taken from Conklin's "Vest

<p>William Tell was a myth.</p>

<p>Coriolanus never allowed his mother to
intercede for Rome.</p>

<p>Blondel, the harper, did not discover the
prison in which Richard I was confined.</p>

<p>Nero was not a monster; he did not kill his
mother nor fiddle over burning Rome.</p>

<p>Alfred never allowed the cakes to burn, nor
ventured into the Danish camp disguised as
a minstrel.</p>

<p>Fair Rosamond was not poisoned by Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Eleanor, but died in the odor of sanctity in
the convent of Godstow.</p>

<p><b>Esperanto.</b>&mdash;Some years ago several educators
attempted to develop an international
language, to be used by the speaking and
writing world at large. This auxiliary language
is made from the roots of other languages,
including the Latin. Its pronunciation
is wholly phonetic. Theoretically, at
least, it has tremendous advantages, for should
it be generally adopted by the civilized nations,
who would, undoubtedly, retain their
native language, there would be a common
basis for international communication, and
people could get together socially and otherwise
without being linguists. The growth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Esperanto is slow, although encouraged by
many educators. It is problematical whether
or not it will make sufficient strides to be generally
accepted. It has its faults, and it is
quite probable that, if an international language,
or auxiliary language, is to be obtained,
some other form of common speech will take
its place; or, Esperanto may be changed, modified,
or enlarged, so as to be more acceptable.
Civilization, however, demands a universal
language, one which will eventually take the
place of all modern languages, the present
languages to be relegated to the dead class;
but natural conditions, association, and patriotism,
or the semblance of them, will, undoubtedly,
make it extremely difficult to introduce
any other form of speech, or of writing,
which would interfere with native tongues.</p>


<p class="ph3">Failures</p>

<p>During 1912, 3,781 manufacturers failed,
with liabilities of nearly $88,500,000. During
the same year 10,918 business men or partnership
concerns went into bankruptcy, with liabilities
exceeding $90,000,000. Eighty-four
banking houses failed, with liabilities of over
$23,500,000; and 600 brokers and transporters
failed, with liabilities of nearly $24,000,000.</p>

<p>According to the commercial agencies the

<p>The year 1912 stands distinguished from
some others years, in that the excess in failures
over the other years is credited to the
increased amount of harm wrought by incompetence
and inexperience, two essentially <b>personal</b>
faults.</p>

<p>For the first time since the records were
compiled in the year 1890, the percentage ascribed
to incompetence stands first in injuriousness
with 30.2 per cent of all failures, as
against 29.7 per cent attributed to lack of
capital, hitherto the most hurtful source of
trouble, but which fell from 31.4 in 1911 and
33.9 in 1910.</p>

<p>Incompetency, on the other hand, moved up
from 27 per cent in 1911 and 26.6 per cent in
1910 to the figure of 30.2 given above. Inexperience
(without other incompetence) rose to
4.6 per cent in 1912 from 4.1 per cent in 1911,
and these two causes together accounted for
the increased failures; while fraud, the third
most important personal cause, fell to 10.3 per
cent from 10.6 per cent in 1911.</p>

<p><b>First Trans-Atlantic Steamship.</b>&mdash;The "Savannah,"
a vessel of only 350 tons, and measuring
100 feet, was the first steamship to cross
the Atlantic Ocean. She was launched in New
York in 1818. She was propelled with paddles
and ship-rigged. She crossed the Atlantic in
26 days, her engine being used only 16 days.
The rest of the time she was under sail.</p>

<p><b>Forests</b>.&mdash;About one-quarter of the United
States is covered with forests, with a total
acreage of about 550,000,000, about one-fifth
of which are owned by the Government. At
the present rate of cutting, and the forest
fires, the forests are decreasing at a very
alarming rate, and a lumber famine is to be
expected within the next century, if the lands
are not properly reforested.</p>


<p class="ph3">Foretelling the Weather</p>

<p>Several years ago the United States Government
established a Weather Bureau and placed
it in charge of scientific men and observers
who were expert in this direction. Weather
Bureau stations are maintained throughout
the United States, and each station communicates
daily with the head office at Washington.
By following the law of averages, by the
use of the barometer and other instruments,
by scientific research and experiment, and because
of the receipt of hourly or daily reports,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the Weather Bureau experts are able to foretell
the weather with a considerable degree of
accuracy. Practically all of the great storms,
tornadoes, and hurricanes are announced in
advance. While this science is still in its infancy,
it has made rapid strides, and each year
shows much improvement in the result.
There are a few simple rules, which may be
used for foretelling the weather, if one possesses
a barometer.</p>

<p>The rapid rise of the barometer indicates
unsettled weather. The gradual rise foretells
settled weather.</p>

<p>When the air is dry and cold, a rising barometer
indicates wind from the north; and if it
has been raining, better weather may occur.</p>

<p>When the air is moist and at a low temperature,
a rising barometer may foretell wind and
rain from the north.</p>

<p>When there is a northerly wind, and the
barometer falls rapidly, there is likely to be a
storm with snow in winter, and heavy rain or
hail in summer.</p>

<p>When the air is dry and the temperature
seasonable, a steady barometer indicates a
continuance of fine weather.</p>

<p>A rapidly falling barometer may foretell
stormy weather.</p>

<p>When the wind is westerly, a rapid fall may
precede a storm coming from the north.</p>

<p>When the wind is southerly, a rise in the
barometer may precede fine weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>When there is much moisture in the air and
considerable heat, a falling barometer may indicate
that a wind and rain storm is coming
from the south.</p>

<p>When the air is dry and cold in winter a
falling barometer may indicate snow. When
the weather is calm and warm, a falling barometer
may be taken to mean rain or squally
weather.</p>


<p><b>Freemasonry.</b>&mdash;Its origin is unknown, but
it is very ancient. It has been traced to the
Knights Templars, to the Crusaders, and
others. It is said that the workmen upon
Solomon's Temple were Masons and that Masonry
was the original trade union or protective
association for workmen, each workman
by signs being able to prove that he had
reached a certain stage of proficiency; but
this has not been substantiated. Some authorities
state that Masonry was introduced into
England in 674 A. D. The first record of the
establishment of a Grand Lodge was at York
in 926. Freemasonry was introduced into
France in 1725, and into America in 1730.
Freemasons are found throughout the entire
world, there being more than a million of them
in the United States and Canada. Other fraternal
or mystic orders, known as Odd Fellows,
Knights of Pythias, Red Men, etc., are
in purpose similar to Masons, and most of
them were founded upon Masonry, Masonry
ante-dating all of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>


<p><b>French Academy.</b>&mdash;Founded by Cardinal
Richelieu in 1635. It has a membership of
forty, known as the "Forty Immortals." Its
principal object is to prepare a dictionary of
the French language and to keep the Gallic
tongue pure and capable of treating the arts
and sciences. The first dictionary appeared
in 1694. The Academy has been very severely
criticised, especially in the selection of its
members, many well-known men of letters
having failed to be elected.</p>


<p><b>Gold in California.</b>&mdash;John W. Marshall, in
1848, in connection with a man named Sutter,
maintained a mill in California. Accidentally
he picked up a small piece of metal which he
discovered to be gold, and immediately the
gold fever became epidemic, and California
was overrun with gold miners.</p>


<p class="ph3">Government</p>

<p>The Constitution of the United Stales is
the basic law of the country, and all other
laws and statutes are framed in a similar
manner, each State, county, town, and city
having its own laws or statutes.</p>

<p>Government, including that of the United
States, is divided into three distinctive departments:
Executive, Legislative, and Judicial.</p>

<p>The Executive head is known as President,
Governor, Mayor, etc., and it is his duty to
execute the laws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The Legislative department is usually subdivided
into two bodies,&mdash;a Senate or Upper
House and a House of Representatives or
Lower House. State Governments are formed
similar to that of the National Government,
the Upper House being known as the Senate,
and the Lower House as the House of Representatives
or Assembly. Most bills are presented
to the Lower House, and do not become
laws until they pass both the Upper and
Lower Houses.</p>

<p>The Legislative authority of a city is usually
vested in a board of Aldermen and a Council
or Common Council, but occasionally there is
only one legislative body, known as a Council.</p>

<p>The Commission Form of Government is
becoming somewhat prevalent. It consists of
a committee elected by the citizens, who have
absolute control of the government, and this
body is both executive and judicial.</p>

<p>The Judicial department consists of several
courts: first, the Supreme Court, and a lower
court, usually known as the Superior Court,
and District or Police Courts. Ordinary cases
are tried by the Police or District Courts and
may be appealed to the Superior Court and
even to the Supreme Court. Besides these
courts there are several courts known as Probate
Court, Court of Equity, etc. The Supreme
Court, as a rule, deals only with questions
at law, and few cases reach it which have
not been appealed from the lower courts.</p>

<p><b>Grain Industry.</b>&mdash;There was raised in the
United States during last year over 3,000,000,000
bushels of Indian corn, about 730,000,000
bushels of wheat, 1,500,000,000 bushels of oats,
about 224,000,000 bushels of barley, about 36,000,000
bushels of rye, and about 19,000,000
bushels of buckwheat.</p>


<p><b>Gravity.</b>&mdash;The force of gravity, unscientifically
speaking, is the influence which one
body has upon another, commonly known as
attraction. All material substances attempt
to draw others to them, and the larger the
substance, the greater its attractiveness or
drawing power. The earth, being larger than
anything near it, draws everything to it. A
ball thrown into the air returns to the earth
as soon as the force which propelled it upward
is exhausted. If the ball were larger
than the earth, the earth would move toward
the ball, or rather each would move toward
the other, but the smaller body would go
the greater distance. The entire universe
would, undoubtedly, come together in one
solid mass if the bodies were not held apart
by laws and energies, which are not yet fully
understood by men. Sir Isaac Newton discovered
the action of gravity, but no one knows
exactly what it is.</p>

with the giant ocean liners of to-day.
She was built in London and launched in
1858. She cost $300,000. She had a length
of 680 ft., breadth of 82-1/2 ft., or 118 ft. including
the paddle boxes, and a height of 58 ft.
Her motive power consisted of eight engines
with a total of 11,000 horse power. She was
slow and unwieldy, and was not a success
except for the laying of the Atlantic cable.</p>

<p><b>Great Tunnels.</b>&mdash;The Arlberg tunnel under
the Alps is 6-3/4 miles long. The Gunnison
tunnel in Colorado is 6 miles long. The
Hoosac tunnel in Massachusetts is 4-3/4 miles
long. The Mont Cenis in Italy and France

Wasatch Mountains is 50 miles long.</p>


<p><b>Hair Growers.</b>&mdash;Notwithstanding the claims
made by advertisers of patent nostrums, the
writer has not as yet heard of a preparation
or treatment which will restore hair after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
hair cells are dead. It appears to be utterly
impossible to grow hair upon a bald head, or
upon a bald spot, unless the roots of the hair
remain, notwithstanding the claims made by
sellers of hair tonics. Falling hair may be
prevented in many cases by the use of a good
hair tonic, but as different people require different
preparations, it is inadvisable to give
any prescription here. A physician should be
consulted, and a prescription obtained from
him, adapted to conditions. Many of the advertised
hair tonics contain lead and other
poisonous drugs. So far as is known, there
is not a preparation or contrivance of any kind
which will restore gray hair to its former
color. All nostrums advertised to do it are
simply hair dyes. The medical profession has
not discovered a method of preventing gray
hair. Most of the advertised hair dyes contain
lead and other poisons, and are dangerous
to use, and the dyeing of the hair is not to be
recommended even though a nonpoisonous dye
is used. As the dye can only cover the hair
in sight, it must be used constantly, or each
separate hair will be of two colors.</p>


<p><b>Half-Century of Life.</b>&mdash;A French statistician
states that a man fifty years of age has
spent 6000 days in sleep, has worked 6500
days; walked 800 days; enjoyed some amusement
4000 days; spent 1500 days in bed; and
was sick 500 days. He further estimates that
this man has eaten 17,000 pounds of bread;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
16,000 pounds of meat; 4600 pounds of vegetables,
eggs, and fish; and has drank 7000
gallons of liquid.</p>


<p><b>Hawaii.</b>&mdash;The Hawaiian Islands have a total
area of 6,740 square miles, and a population
of about 160,000. The climate is semitropical,
and pineapple growing and sugar making are
the principal industries.</p>


<p><b>Hay Industry.</b>&mdash;Over 48,000,000 acres are
devoted to hay, producing nearly 4,500,000
tons, of a value not far from $50,000,000 a
year.</p>


<p><b>Health.</b>&mdash;Ninety per cent. of common ailments,
and fully one-half of serious diseases,
may be prevented if one gives a reasonable
amount of attention to the care of his health.
It would be out of place to present, in this
book, any rules or regulations for the maintenance
of health, assuming that it is possible
to do so. Any good physician is competent
to advise in the majority of cases, and will prescribe
beneficial exercise and proper food.
Most of us eat too much, and exercise too little.
The province of the physician is as much to
keep people well as it is to cure them. Good
sense and economy suggest that a physician
be consulted at least once a year, even by those
in apparent health. So-called "doctors' books"
should be avoided, unless recommended by
regular practitioners.</p>

<p><b>Influence of the Ocean on the Climate.</b>&mdash;The
ocean has much to do with the climate of its
coast. As a rule, land on or near the ocean
has more irregular weather, and is subject to
more frequent changes than is territory some
distance away from it. The ocean, besides,
exercises a great influence on heat and cold.
The land in close proximity to it has a
warmer climate than territory far removed
from it. While the thermometer in the summer
may not show great variation, breezes coming
from the ocean give an apparent coolness
which does not exist inland. For this reason
there are more summer resorts located on the
ocean than away from it.</p>


<p><b>Insane.</b>&mdash;There are, in the United States,
confined in the insane asylums, about 172,200
persons, about 25,600 being foreigners, 25,000
naturalized citizens, and 121,500 native-born
persons. The feeble-minded number
about 150,000.</p>


<p><b>Iron Industry.</b>&mdash;The United States produces
annually about 24,000,000 tons of pig iron and
about the same amount of steel.</p>


<p><b>Jewelry Industry.</b>&mdash;Nearly $65,000,000 is
invested in the manufacture of jewelry, and
the annual value of the output exceeds $80,000,000.</p>


<p><b>John Doe and Richard Roe.</b>&mdash;Two fictitious
names, used in law, one representing the plaintiff
and the other the defendant. In writs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
ejection these names are substituted when the
real names of the parties are unknown or in
doubt.</p>


<p><b>Kissing the Bible.</b>&mdash;The Jews introduced the
custom of swearing on the Bible, and the custom
is still maintained throughout the civilized
world, some of the courts even now requiring
that the Bible be literally kissed before one
gives testimony.</p>


<p><b>Koran.</b>&mdash;The sacred book of the Mohammedans.
The doctrine of the Koran is the
unity of God and the existence of one true
religion, with changeable ceremonies. Punishment
for the bad, and rewards for the good,
are presented and exemplified by stories taken
from the Bible and other works. Most of
the matter is supposed to have been borrowed
from Jewish works, and bears traces of Jewish
influence.</p>


<p><b>Language of Gems.</b>&mdash;Amethyst represents
peace of mind; Bloodstone signifies that one's
absence is mourned; Diamond, pride; Emerald,
success in love; Ruby stands for a cheerful
mind; Sapphire represents chastity, and
was supposed to stand for pure thoughts;
Topaz, fidelity, and is supposed to calm the
passions; Turquoise, happiness and success;
Garnet, fidelity; Onyx, reciprocal love; Opal,
pure thoughts; Pearl, innocence and purity.</p>


<p><b>Languages of the World.</b>&mdash;It is estimated
that there are 3424 distinct languages or dia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>lects,
about 1600 being spoken in America,
about 940 in Asia, not far from 600 in Europe,
and about 275 in Africa. Probably more than
150,000,000 people speak the English language,
120,000,000 the German, 90,000,000 Russian,
60,000,000 French, 55,000,000 Spanish, 40,000,000
Italian, 30,000,000 Portuguese. The
English dictionaries contain exceeding 600,000
words, about 300,000 of which are more
or less technical and obsolete. Ordinary conversation
does not require the use of more
than 2,000 words. It is said that one can
make himself understood in any language if
his vocabulary is about 1,500 words.</p>

<p><b>Law.</b>&mdash;Every one within the United States
is amenable: first, to the laws laid down by
the Constitution of the United States; secondly,
to any laws which may be made by
Congress; thirdly, to State laws; fourthly, to
county law; fifthly, to local ordinances passed
by the city or town. No local ordinance can
be enforced if it is contrary to the law of the
State, and no State law holds if it is at variance
with the Constitution of the United

passes upon the constitutionality of all laws
made within the State, and the Supreme Court
of the United States is the final Court of appeal.
A law made by Congress is not valid
if it is declared unconstitutional by the Supreme
Court of the United States, nor may
any State law be enforced if the Supreme
Court of that State considers it unconstitutional.</p>

<p><b>Liquor and Wine Industry.</b>&mdash;The United
States produces about 101,000,000 gallons of
whisky, about 2,700,000 gallons of rum, about
3,400,000 gallons of gin, 24,500,000 gallons of
alcohol, and about 14,000,000 gallons of commercial
alcohol,&mdash;a total of about 175,500,000
gallons. The United States produces over
2,000,000 gallons of malt liquors and nearly
57,000,000 gallons of wine annually.</p>


<p><b>Literature.</b>&mdash;Literature is not, and probably
never will be, satisfactorily defined. Broadly
speaking, it is any form of written or printed
words upon any subject. More specifically
defined, the term "literature" would apply to
essays, poetry, stories, and other works of
fiction of the grade acceptable to the best
magazines and book publishers. Works of
history may be called literature, and scientific
works come under this classification; but historical
writers are usually called historians,
and scientific writers are known as scientists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Story writers are usually classified as novelists,
and newspaper writers as journalists. A
book, commonly, if not technically, speaking,
is a volume usually bound in board covers and
containing one hundred or more pages, but
it may be a book if there are only a dozen
pages with covers of paper.</p>


<p><b>Magnetic Poles.</b>&mdash;The magnetic poles are
not, as most people suppose, identical with
the geographical poles, the north magnetic
pole being south of the geographical North
Pole, and the south magnetic pole being north
of the geographical South Pole. The north
magnetic pole is located at about 77° 59´, and
the south at about 72° 23´.</p>


<p><b>Mammoth Cave.</b>&mdash;Mammoth Cave, probably
the best known of similar freaks of Nature,
is located in Kentucky, and has a length of
nine miles. It contains many avenues, chambers,
domes, lakes, rivers, and waterfalls.
Echo River, inside of the cave, is 3/4 of a mile
in length, from a few feet to 200 ft. wide,
and has a depth of from 10 to 30 ft. It is well
filled with fish, none of which have eyes.</p>


<p><b>Meat Industry.</b>&mdash;There are, in the United
States, about 1650 slaughter houses employing
nearly 110,000 people with about $4,000,000
capital invested. The annual product of the
meat industry is not far from $1,400,000,000.</p>


<p><b>Medicine Chests.</b>&mdash;Every one should maintain
a medicine chest or shelf containing sim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>ple
remedies, but these should never be selected
without the advice of a physician.
Thousands of persons injure themselves by
self-dosing. When in the slightest doubt,
visit or call your doctor. Most ailments can
be prevented or cured by a skillful physician,
but if allowed to run they may result seriously
or fatally. Do not take chances with yourself.</p>


<p><b>Microscope.</b>&mdash;The first microscope is said to
have been invented by a Dutchman in 1590,
but its invention has been attributed to Galileo
in 1610. The microscope has been perfected
until a millionth part of a grain of
blood may be detected by means of the spectrum
lens.</p>


<p><b>Mineral Industry.</b>&mdash;The minerals mined in
the United States every year have a value of
about $904,000,000.</p>


<p><b>Mining Industry.</b>&mdash;Nearly 1,140,000 men are
engaged in the mines of the United States,
over 90 per cent of whom are wage earners.</p>


<p><b>Moon.</b>&mdash;The moon is the earth's only satellite.
It circles around the earth every 27 days,
7 hours, and 43.2 minutes, on the average;
but because its motion is common with the
earth around the sun, the mean duration of
the lunar month is 29 days, 12 hours, 44.05
minutes. The distance from the earth to the
moon is from 238,850 to 252,820 miles, although
at times the moon is only 216,477<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
miles from the earth. The moon's diameter
is 2,162 miles. The surface of the moon contains
about 14,685,000 square miles, or about
four times the area of Europe. The moon,
although very much smaller than the planets,
exerts a stronger attractive force on the earth
because of its nearness. The moon is, unscientifically
speaking, drawing everything on
the earth towards it, while at the same time
the earth is exerting the same attractive force
upon the moon. Because of this, the oceans,
being composed of water, which is easily movable,
respond and move with the moon, causing
the tides. This same attractive force is
brought to bear upon the earth itself, but because
it is of greater density it is not perceptibly
affected. Theoretically, every lake and
pond has a tide, but the motion of the water
is too slight to be measured. The moon is
supposed to possess neither atmosphere nor
water. Thousands of ages ago the lunar surface
was subjected to terrible volcanic actions
which forced the land into ridges, some of
them supposed to exceed 20,000 feet in height,
and rents and depressions of corresponding
depths. The surface of the moon appears to
be desolate and to be unfitted to support any
form of life.</p>


<p><b>Mortality.</b>&mdash;About 15 people out of every
thousand of the population of the United
States die during each year. The percentage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of male deaths is somewhat larger than that
of female, due to accidents. The annual death
rate per thousand is: 13.7 in Los Angeles, 15
in San Francisco, 17 in Denver, 19 in Washington,
D. C., 14.6 in Chicago, 14.3 in Indianapolis,
15.5 in Louisville, 20.2 in New Orleans,
18.7 in Baltimore, 16.8 in Boston, 14.0 in Detroit,
10.7 in Minneapolis, 11.4 in St. Paul,
14.4 in Kansas City, 15.8 in St. Louis, 14.7 in
Omaha, 16 in New York, 16.5 in Cincinnati,
12.9 in Cleveland, 16.4 in Philadelphia, 15.8
in Pittsburgh, 20.1 in Memphis.</p>


<p><b>Mortgages.</b>&mdash;A mortgage is a bill-of-sale
from the owner of property to another competent
to hold property. The one giving the
mortgage is called the mortgagee, and the one
to whom it is made is known as the mortgagor.
A mortgage differs from a bill-of-sale
in that the mortgagor cannot obtain ownership
of the property mortgaged, unless the
amount involved is not paid him at the expiration
of the mortgage, or the interest is not
met. All mortgages must be registered.
Mortgaged property cannot be moved, altered,
or changed without the consent of the mortgagor.
The property, unless it is land, should
be insured, and the insurance policy made
payable to the mortgagor in case of loss by
fire, but the mortgagor can collect only that
part of the insurance money which represents
the amount of the mortgage. Should the
mortgagee fail to pay interest at the period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
stated in the mortgage, or should he be unable
or refuse to liquidate the mortgage at its expiration,
the mortgagor cannot seize the property
except by act of law. It must be advertised
and sold at auction. If the mortgaged
property brings a price lower than the face
of the mortgage, the mortgagor loses the difference,
and has to bear the expense of foreclosure.
If more than the face of the mortgage
is realized, the mortgagee is entitled to
what is received, less the face of the mortgage
and the expenses of foreclosure.</p>


<p><b>Natural Gas.</b>&mdash;A gas generated underground,
and due to chemical action beneath the earth's
surface. It is found in various parts of the
world, and is used for fuel and illuminating,
largely for the former.</p>


<p><b>Naturalization.</b>&mdash;Any foreigner or alien, except
those of the Mongolian or Brown Race,
may become a citizen of the United States,
and be entitled to every privilege granted to
natural-born citizens, except that he cannot
become President or Vice-President of the
United States. An alien cannot make application
for naturalization or citizenship until
he is 18 years of age, and he cannot apply
for his Second or Final Paper of Naturalization
until he has lived in the United States
for at least five years, and he must make his
Declaration of Intention two or more years
before he applies for his Second or Final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Paper. The applicant must be a resident of
the State in which he makes petition for naturalization
not less than one year, and have
lived at least four years additional in the same
State, or in some other State. He must make
application to the United States District Court
in the State in which he lives. The cost of
becoming naturalized is less than $5.00. A
married woman does not have to be naturalized
if her husband has become a citizen of
the United States, and the children of the
naturalized parents become citizens at 21 years
of age without taking out naturalization papers.
Full particulars regarding the process
of naturalization are very plainly and explicitly
stated in a book entitled "How to Obtain
Citizenship," by Nathaniel C. Fowler, Jr.</p>


<p><b>Newspapers.</b>&mdash;A newspaper is a periodical
issued as often as once a week, and contains
the news of the day, either local or general,
or both. The majority of newspapers are of
four or eight pages, but often the number of
pages run as high as 24, or even 72, and occasionally
100 pages are issued at a time. In
the United States and Canada, there are published
over 2,600 daily newspapers, about 75
tri-weekly, a little less than 650 semi-weekly,
considerable more than 17,000 weekly. Of
other periodicals, about 60 are published every
two weeks, somewhat less than 300 semi-monthly,
more than 3,000 monthly, about 80<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
bi-monthly, and less than 250 quarterly. Periodicals
published less often than once a week
are not considered newspapers, although they
may contain news.</p>


<p><b>New York Stock Exchange.</b>&mdash;A single seat,
carrying with it membership in the New York
Stock Exchange, has been sold for as much
as $96,000, and the lowest price recorded is
$49,500.</p>


<p><b>Nicknames of States.</b>&mdash;Alabama, "Cotton
State"; Alaska, "Eldorado of the North";
Arkansas, "Bear"; California, "Golden

<p><b>Nitroglycerine.</b>&mdash;Nitroglycerine is made of
common glycerine mixed with strong nitric
and sulphuric acids, and is extremely explosive
and dangerous. It has to be exploded by concussion
or shock, and not by fire. It is used
for blasting and other purposes, and occasionally
is taken in very small doses as a medicine,
but never should be used medicinally except
by the advice of a physician who should
be present when it is taken.</p>


<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A note should be signed in ink, but
a pencil signature is good in law. A note is
not payable on demand unless it so states. A
note may be payable to order or to bearer. If
payable to order, and transferred, it must be
endorsed. The endorser of a note is liable for
its payment, if the maker of it does not pay it.
Each signer of a joint note is liable for the
full amount. Notes do not bear interest unless
so stated. "Value received" should be
written in every note, but it is not essential.</p>


<p><b>Ocean Ownership.</b>&mdash;The ocean is common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
property, and no one has any legal title to it,
except that each country has jurisdiction over
the sea within three miles of the shore, but
these three miles are usually reckoned from
promontories, and not necessarily from the
coast-line, so that a nation may have control
of a vast area of water and several hundred
miles from shore.</p>


<p><b>Old Time Ships.</b>&mdash;The glory of the American
merchant service, so far as sailing vessels
are concerned, has passed into history. Comparatively
few sailing vessels, save coasting
schooners, ply the seas, as steam has taken
the place of sail. The majority of old ship captains
are either dead or commanding ocean
liners or coastwise steamers. In the old days,
sailing clipper ships made the trip from New
York to San Francisco in one hundred days,
while the voyage of ordinary ships was two
or three times as long. The old ship "Lightning"
sailed from Boston to Liverpool at a
greater speed than that obtained by any steamship
of its day, the vessel often logging over
500 miles in 24 hours, and it made the trip
in a little less than 14 days. The "James
Baines" sailed from Boston to Liverpool in
12 days and 6 hours, and broke the sailing
record between these two ports. The same
vessel made the trip from Liverpool to Melbourne,
Australia, in 63 days and returned in
69 days. The "Red Jacket" sailed from New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
York to Liverpool in 13 days, 1 hour, and 25
minutes. The "Flying Cloud" and "Andrew
Jackson" sailed from New York to San
Francisco in 89 days, and the "Sea Witch"
made the trip from Canton, China, to New
York in 74 days, 14 hours. These early clipper
ships were quite small, many of them not
being over 200 tons. The first large clipper
ship was the "Ann McKim," which was 43 ft.
long, and 493 tons burden. Subsequent sailing
vessels of enormous size were built, the
"John Bertram" having a tonnage of 1080,
the "Gamecock" 1,320, the "Staghound"
1,535, the "Flying Cloud" 1,783, the "Staffordshire"
1,817, the "Sovereign of the Seas"
2,421 tons, and the "Great Republic" 4,555
tons.</p>


<p><b>Palmistry.</b>&mdash;The study of the lines of the
palm, which the ancients believed indicated
character and future. Palmistry is to-day
practiced by three classes of people: (1) professional
palmists, most of whom are charlatans;
(2) as a diversion; (3) by superstitious
people who believe in it. A scientific
study of the subject does not furnish any evidence
that the lines of the hand have any
special significance, and no scientific person
gives them any credence.</p>


<p><b>Partnership.</b>&mdash;A partnership is an agreement,
usually written, between two or more persons,
for the doing of business or for the carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
out of any contract or for the accomplishment
of any work. The partners may have equal
ownership, or it may be unevenly divided.
In the equal partnerships, each partner has
the same financial interest and share in the
profits, and also the same right of control.
In other partnerships, the financial investment
or interests are unevenly divided; and the one
who holds more than half interest controls
the business, unless otherwise provided for in
the partnership agreement. Partners may be
in name only, and not own any of the property.
Active partners are those who give
practically all of their time to the conducting
of the business. Silent partners are not likely
to take any active part in the management of
the business, but they may control it, if their
financial interest is sufficient. Under common
law, no partner has a right to engage in any
other business which would injure the partnership,
unless permitted to do so by the other
partners. The acts of one partner bind all
of the rest. If one partner commits fraud in
the name of the firm, the others are financially
responsible, although they may have had no
knowledge of his action. The partnership or
business may or may not be liable for the private
debts of any one partner. Usually a
partner cannot be held for more than his interest
in the firm. Partnerships may be dissolved
by mutual agreement or by judicial
act, and it is usual to publish the dissolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of partnership in one or more of the local
newspapers, and to send notices of it to the
trade. A limited partnership does not hold
any partner or the concern itself liable for
more than the amount of the property in the
business, but a partnership will not be considered
limited unless it is publicly announced.</p>


<p class="ph3">Patent Medicines</p>

<p>It has been said, and with some degree of
truth, that Americans are self-dosers, and
that they are prone to attempt to cure themselves,
even of serious diseases, without consulting
a physician.</p>

<p>The sale of patent medicines is enormous,
although I think it is diminishing in volume,
due to the exposures which have appeared in
many periodicals, and to the better education
of the people.</p>

<p>A patent medicine, technically speaking,
is a concoction or drug, or combination of
drugs, claimed to be a remedy or cure for a
specific ill or for all of the ills that the human
flesh is heir to. It is manufactured in large
quantities, and bottled or put up with attractive
labels, with more or less directions given
for its use. Many of the patent medicines are
either absolutely ineffective or are positively
dangerous. Many of them contain a large
percentage of alcohol, which acts as a transient
tonic, and produces an exhilaration which
the sufferer is likely to consider beneficial.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
The effect of the alcohol soon wears off, and
the taker is much worse for having swallowed
it.</p>

<p>Other patent medicines contain cocaine and
other dangerous drugs, which never should be
taken without the advice of a physician. The
effect of some patent medicines is likely to
be immediate and to appear to be efficacious.
Some patent medicines, however, are made of
pure drugs, and are really valuable. I am,
however, opposed to the use of patent medicines,
even of those which are carefully and
scientifically compounded.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the layman cannot diagnose
his trouble, and the label on the bottle,
or the pamphlet accompanying it, is likely to
confuse him, and in many cases makes him
feel that he is suffering from an ailment or
disease which does not exist.</p>

<p>Headache powders, cough medicines, tonics
of all kinds, soothing syrup for babies, should
be conscientiously avoided, unless prescribed
by a physician. They are likely to contain
dangerous drugs, and may have no medicinal
properties at all.</p>

<p>Because a certain medicine has worked well
with one person should not be taken as evidence
that another can take it to his advantage.
Similar symptoms may exist, and yet
the root of the trouble be entirely different.</p>

<p>Even if every patent medicine were pure
and scientifically compounded, I would advise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
against their use, unless recommended by a
physician, who is likely to diagnose correctly
the trouble and to apply the right remedy.</p>

<p>Physicians are not infallible, but every reputable
physician is a graduate of a medical
school, a reader of current medical magazines,
and is constantly in touch, by experience, with
other physicians and with human ailments.
Even if he is not an expert, his close proximity
to disease makes him far more reliable than
the label on the medicine bottle.</p>

<p>I would advise no one to place himself
in the hands of any physician who is not a
member of one of the great medical associations,
maintained by both the allopathic and
homeopathic schools.</p>

<p>These associations will not admit into membership
any one who has not been properly
instructed, and who is not reliable. Any physician
of standing, and with a sufficient knowledge
of the human body, can obtain membership
in these associations, and those who are
not members may be looked upon with suspicion,
although it is quite likely that some
of them are reliable; but as they are outside
of the associations, they cannot have the facilities
of consultation and experience, which are
given to those in regular standing in an association.</p>

<p>It is obvious that one of even ordinary ability,
who is educated in the profession, is more
reliable than one who doctors by his wits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
even though he may appear to be successful.
Although there are some charlatans in the
profession, who practice in their own interest
more than in that of their patients, the average
physician represents the highest order
of civilization. He knows at the start that
his profession is not likely to bring him heavy
financial return. He goes into it with his eyes
open. He is under the strictest rules and
regulations, and cannot maintain his standing
in the associations, or with the public,
if he does not practice legitimately. He has
every facility at his command, and although
he is not always successful, he is far better
able to produce results than is one who has
not been properly educated, and who lacks
experience and association with other doctors,
and who has not had hospital practice. Every
reputable physician has not only graduated
from a medical school, but was given opportunity
to practice in hospitals and elsewhere
before he became a family physician. The
so-called specialist began as a family physician,
and gives his time somewhat exclusively
to one disease or to surgery. The surgeon,
while a regular physician, specializes in surgery,
and comparatively few family practitioners
will handle a serious surgical case,
except in emergencies. They refer the patient
to the skilled surgeon.</p>

<p>The physician is both a curer and preventor
of disease. I would advise every one, no mat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>ter
how healthy he may be, to consult a reputable
physician once a year, and to be overhauled,
so to speak. Most troubles can be
obviated if taken in time. A symptom seemingly
serious to the one having it may be of
little consequence, and yet it may be the forerunner
of an incurable disease. If a good
physician is consulted in time, he may either
obviate the trouble or prevent its rapid increase.
No one should attempt to diagnose
his own condition. Even the physician will
not do so for himself, because no one can tell
by his feelings exactly what is the matter
with him or what would better be done. The
physician when sick, consults other physicians,
if his trouble is of any seriousness. The
expense of an annual examination need not
exceed two or three dollars, and some physicians
will make it for a dollar. They are likely
to locate any trouble, although it may have
just appeared and the symptom be slight.
They will prescribe a treatment, which cannot
fail to be of benefit to those who consult
them. Therefore, I say, visit a good physician
at least once a year, irrespective of your
health.</p>

<p>In every city, and in many of the towns,
are practicing alleged physicians or doctors,
who claim to be unusually expert and able
to cure where others fail, or even to cure what
cannot be cured. Some of them are graduates
of medical schools, and are really good phy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>sicians,
but most of them are irresponsible
and without real ability. Their method frequently
makes the patient feel that he is being
cured, and cured rapidly. They use appliances
and drugs which have an immediate
effect, usually to the patients' injury; or they
practice the same as regular physicians do
and give the patient false encouragement. It
seems to me obvious that no so-called outside
practitioner, who is not a member of the associations,
can possibly possess any information
or know of any method of treatment with
which the regular physicians are unfamiliar.
These charlatans play upon the feelings of the
patient, and it is said that some of them keep
him sick for financial reasons. Therefore, I
warn the reader against any physician who
is not a member of one of the two great associations,
and who is not recognized by the
profession at large. Even though some of
them are skillful, it is safer to employ a physician
of standing than to take one who makes
a business of practicing, and who is not answerable
to the rules and regulations enforced
by the associations, and who cannot, because
of his removal from them, obtain and enjoy
the privilege of consultation with other members
of his craft. Do not take chances with
your body. Better risk the few mistakes
made by physicians than by your own doctor.</p>


<p><b>Perpetual Motion.</b>&mdash;Scientists, particularly
early ones, made frantic and continuous en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>deavors
to invent what was supposed to be
perpetual motion; that is, a machine which
will keep perpetually in motion without being
replenished or supplied with outside energy.
About 60 years ago scientific bodies refused
to consider it, as it was proved to be impossible.
The "Scientific American," many years
ago, likened perpetual motion to an energy
which will permit a man to lift himself by
his boot-straps.</p>


<p><b>Petroleum Industry.</b>&mdash;The annual production
is considerably more than 9,000,000,000
gallons a year.</p>


<p><b>Philippine Islands.</b>&mdash;The Philippine Islands
consist of over 3,000 islands, having an area
of about 115,000 square miles. The population
exceeds 7,500,000; and the density of
population is about 67 to the square mile, as
against 26 to the square mile in the United
States. The climate is tropical.</p>


<p><b>Pianoforte.</b>&mdash;The piano or pianoforte is said
to have been invented in Italy and to have
appeared in 1714. Germany, however, claims
the honor of its invention. It was introduced
into England in 1766.</p>


<p><b>Plate Glass.</b>&mdash;The sand, out of which glass
is made, is melted until it is of about the consistency
of molasses. It is then poured into
a casting trough or a table mounted on wheels
so it can be run close to the mouth of the fur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>nace.
The molten glass is poured into the
trough through a sluice-way, and before it
hardens, heavy rollers pass over it, reducing it
to the required thickness. It is rolled to
about 9-16 of an inch, and then by further
rolling and polishing it is reduced to the required
thickness. It further passes through
a smelting oven which thoroughly hardens
it. Then, it is again polished.</p>


<p><b>Playing Cards.</b>&mdash;The origin is unknown, although
they appeared in Europe in 1350. It
is claimed that the Arabs used playing cards
at a much earlier date. It is estimated that
over sixteen million packs of playing cards
are made annually in the United States.</p>


<p><b>Pole Star.</b>&mdash;This is a star of the second
magnitude, found at the extremity of the
handle of the Little Dipper.</p>

<p>According to the census of 1910, there are
in continental United States, on the average,
30.9 inhabitants to each square mile of land
area, or nearly seven times the number per
square mile shown for the much smaller area
of 1790, and nearly three times the number
shown for 1860. The decrease in the average
number of inhabitants per square mile at the
census of 1810 and 1850 was due in each case
to large accessions of thinly populated territory
during the decade preceding the census.</p>

<p>In the order of their density of population
the nine geographic divisions of the country
rank as follows: Middle Atlantic, 193.2 inhabitants
per square mile; New England,
105.7; East North Central, 74.3; East South
Central, 46.8; South Atlantic, 45.3; West North
Central, 22.8; West South Central, 20.4; Pacific,
13.2; and Mountain, 3.1. The changes
in density from census to census correspond
precisely with the changes in area and the total
number of inhabitants. It may be noted,
however, that on account of the rapid increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
in their population the Pacific states in 1910
for the first time are approaching, in density
of population, conditions found in the states
between the Mississippi River and the Rocky
Mountains.</p>


<p><b>Porto Rico.</b>&mdash;Porto Rico contains about
3,600 square miles, and has a population of
considerable more than a million. The climate
is tropical and the land is extremely fertile.</p>


<p><b>Postage Stamps.</b>&mdash;They were invented in
1834, and were introduced into America in
1847.</p>


<p><b>Poultry and Egg Industry.</b>&mdash;Nearly 500,000,000
of poultry, including chickens, turkeys,
geese, and pigeons, are raised in the United
States annually. The total value is about
$203,000,000. Each year the production of
eggs is about 1,600,000,000 dozen. The people
of the United States eat about 5-1/2 fowls per
year per capita, and a little over 17 dozen eggs.</p>

<p><b>Printing Presses.</b>&mdash;There are three distinct
classes of printing presses: (1) The ordinary
job press which is used for the printing of
cards, letter-heads, billheads, and other small
matter. It is run by power or by a foot
treadle. Each card or piece of paper is fed
into the press by hand and removed by hand.
The average speed is from 1,000 to 1,200 an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
hour, but the most expert feeders can handle
about 1,500 cards an hour, and the record is
not far from 2,000. (2) The cylinder press.
This press is used for the printing of weekly
newspapers, books, catalogues, and other large
work. The type is placed upon a flat bed having
a lateral movement, and the paper is fed
by hand onto a cylinder which revolves over
the moving bed. These presses have a speed
of from 1,000 to 2,000 an hour, but comparatively
few hand-feeders can handle more than
1,500, or 1,600 sheets in an hour. (3) The
perfecting press. This press is used exclusively
for the printing of large city newspapers,
and some books, and catalogues are
printed upon it. The type matter is cast into
to a cylinder. The paper to be printed upon
stereotypes of circular form which are attached
is in a continuous roll and passes between the
stereotype cylinder and another roller. The
paper is fed into the press automatically, and
is automatically folded and counted. The
largest perfecting press in the world will print,
fold, and count both sides of an eight-page
paper at the rate of 300,000 copies an hour, but
the average perfecting press does not deliver
more than 75,000 copies an hour. The perfecting
presses used for books, magazines, and
catalogues run at a much slower speed.</p>


<p><b>Production of Books.</b>&mdash;In 1911, 8,183 books
were produced by American authors of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
1,024 were fiction; 917 were on theology and
religion; 919 of essays and literature; 527 on
hygiene; 734 juvenile; 685 of poetry and
drama; 300 educational; 196 were devoted to
the fine arts; and 86 to music.</p>


<p><b>Public Debt of the United States.</b>&mdash;The interest-bearing
debt of the United States is
$964,631,630, and the non-interest-bearing debt
is $375,974,389. The United States has issued
$946,242,270 in gold certificates, $482,367,666
in silver certificates, and treasury notes
to the amount of $2,846,260. At the last accounting
the United States treasury had on
hand in cash $1,564,416,169.</p>


<p><b>Public Schools.</b>&mdash;The public school system
originated in Massachusetts and Connecticut
shortly after the settlement of those States.
Schools were not entirely free when originally
established. They have now become common
all over the United States, and their maintenance
is required by law.</p>


<p><b>Pure Food.</b>&mdash;Pure food laws enacted by the
United States Government, and by State and
City Governments, are supposed to protect
the consumer against adulterated foods. The
United States law, however, has no jurisdiction
over food manufactured or put out in any
of the States, unless it is carried from one
State to another. The local food laws have
to do only with the communities covered. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
present law does not appear to be sufficient
to protect the public fully. The statement
written on many food packages, reading
"Guaranteed Under The Food and Drugs
Act, June 30, 1906. No. &mdash;&mdash;," must not
be considered as proof positive of purity. It
simply means that the contents of the package
or bottle is according to the prescription or
formula registered with the Government, and
does not stand for quality or purity. Benzoate
of soda and other preservatives may be
legally used, provided a statement to that
effect is made upon the package. Chemists
differ as to the injurious effect of benzoate of
soda, but it is not advocated by any eminent
authority. Most of the pure food experts are
opposed to its use, irrespective of any injurious
effect it may have upon the consumer,
because this preservative will effectively kill
the odor of putrefaction and disguise the taste
and smell of rotten or spoiled fruit and other
products. The consumer will do well to refuse
to purchase any article or food containing
benzoate of soda or other preservative,
for first-class and healthy meat, fruit, and
vegetables do not require a chemical preservative.
Artificial coloring may not be injurious,
as so little of it is required, but food artificially
preserved may be dangerous, and very likely
is impure, and may not have been fresh when
canned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>


<p><b>Pyramids.</b>&mdash;the pyramids were supposed to
have been constructed between the fifth and
twelfth dynasties in Middle Egypt, and not
to have been used for tombs. They are built
upon a square base, with sides facing the
points of the compass, and the earlier pyramids
were constructed of horizontal layers of rough
blocks fastened together with mortar. In the
center of the pyramid, near the base, was built
a chamber reached by a passage from the
north side. It is said that some of them contain
emblems or symbols, which are now used
in masonry. Whether or not there were masons
at the time they were built, has not yet
been discovered. Many of the stones weigh
as much as thirty tons each, and no one has
yet been able to ascertain the power used for
their transmission.</p>


<p><b>Railroads.</b>&mdash;The railroads of the United
States employ nearly 1,700,000 men, or about
680 per hundred miles of track. The railroads
occupy over 244,000 miles of track.
The most powerful locomotive in the world
runs in Virginia, and weighs 540,000 pounds.
The heaviest electric locomotive is maintained
by the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad and weighs
about 192,000 pounds. The most expensive
locomotives cost about $37,000, and an ordinary
locomotive costs from $15,000 to $20,000.
An ordinary box car weighs 36,000 pounds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and a day coach about 112,000 pounds.
Sleeping cars weigh from 115,000 to 152,000
pounds. The fastest short-distance run on
record was made by the Empire State Express,
at the rate of 112-1/2 miles per hour. A
New York train ran a distance of 44 miles in
33 minutes, or at the rate of 80 miles an
hour, and a New York Central train made
the distance between New York and Chicago,
965 miles, in 15 hours and 43 minutes, or at
the rate of 62-1/2 miles per hour. A New York
Central train ran a short distance at the rate
of about 112-1/2 miles an hour, and a Florida
train ran 5 miles at the rate of 120 miles an
hour. During the last year there were 5,483
accidents by collision and 8,215 by derailments,
and a total of 15,743 accidents; 318 passengers
were killed, and 16,386 were injured;
3,635 employees were killed, and 142,442 injured;
6,632 persons not connected with the
railroads and not riding on trains were
killed, and 10,710 injured. The number of
passengers carried during the year was nearly
a billion. The railroads of the United States,
not including the switching and terminal companies,
employ nearly 670,000 men, or about
678 men to every 100 miles of track.</p>


<p><b>Referendum.</b>&mdash;A law by which all legislation
may be referred to the people, either for
its ratification or rejection. The Initiative is a
process by which any law may be enacted, if
requested by a specified number of citizens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
The Initiative and Referendum are becoming
common, and their advocates believe that they
are the solution to many of our political problems.</p>


<p><b>Religious Denominations.</b>&mdash;In the United
States there are 95,800 Adventists, about
5,635,000 Baptists, about 739,000 Congregationalists,
about 1,534,000 Disciples of Christ,
about 2,290,000 Lutherans, about 6,280,000
Methodists, about 1,944,000 Presbyterians,
about 957,000 Protestant Episcopalians, about
312,000 United Brethren, about 71,000 Unitarians,
about 53,000 Universalists, and about
13,000,000 Roman Catholics.</p>


<p><b>Roads.</b>&mdash;The mileage of all public roads in
the United States is about 2,200,000 miles,
there being a little over 59,000 miles of stone
road and about 103,000 of gravel road. A
sand-clay road costs about $725.00 per mile,
gravel a little over $2,000.00, macadam about
$5,000.00, and bituminous macadam about
$10,350.</p>


<p><b>Round Table.</b>&mdash;Tradition says that it was
modeled after a table made by Joseph of Arimathea,
and was an imitation of the one used
at the Last Supper. It is said to have had a
seating capacity variously estimated at from
thirteen to one hundred and fifty. According
to the legend dealing with King Arthur and
his knights, it was a round marble table made
by the Enchanter Merlin for Uther Pendra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>gon.
Later it came into the possession of the
King of Camelard, and was given by him to
Arthur on his marriage to the king's daughter
Guinevere. The term Round Table is much
used in the United States, and refers to a
table, usually round, occupied habitually by
the same diners.</p>


<p><b>Royal Academy.</b>&mdash;Founded in London in
1768. It is an association of artists, and maintains
a free school of art. It holds an annual
exhibition of paintings and sculptures.</p>


<p><b>Royal Society.</b>&mdash;One of the most celebrated
associations in the world. Organized in London
in 1660 for the promotion of scientific
investigation.</p>


<p><b>School Statistics.</b>&mdash;There are, in the United
States, 36,260 men and 5,025 women acting as
professors and instructors in universities, colleges,
and technical schools. The common
schools contain nearly 18,000,000 enrolled
pupils, with an average daily attendance of
nearly 13,000,000. These schools employ
nearly 525,000 teachers, who receive an average
monthly salary of about $62.00. The estimated
value of public school property is considerably
more than $1,000,000,000, and the
annual cost of maintaining these schools
exceeds $426,000,000.</p>


<p><b>Seasickness.</b>&mdash;Although there are several
advertised remedies which claim to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
or to cure seasickness, it is probable that none
of them are efficacious for all persons. Seasickness
is not perfectly understood. Some
people suffer from it and some do not. Of
course, the condition of the stomach and liver
has much to do with it. If one is bilious he
is pretty sure to become seasick. Before
taking a voyage, it is well to diet or to live
on plain food for a while. Do not remain in
your stateroom or in the cabin. Get all of
the fresh air you can. Lie down and don't
refuse to eat sparingly. Many persons ward
off seasickness by retiring before the vessel
leaves the port. Some people, even sailors,
suffer from seasickness with every voyage. A
good remedy is an emetic, either warm salt
water, or warm mustard water.</p>


<p><b>Seven Chief Virtues.</b>&mdash;These, as defined by
the Roman Catholic Church, are as follows:
(1) Faith, (2) Hope, (3) Charity, (4) Prudence,
(5) Temperance, (6) Justice, (7) Fortitude.</p>


<p><b>Seven Corporal Works of Mercy.</b>&mdash;According
to the Roman Catholic Church, these are
as follows: (1) To bury the dead, (2) to
clothe the naked, (3) to feed the hungry, (4)
to give drink to the thirsty, (5) to shelter the
homeless, (6) to visit those in prison, (7) to
administer unto the sick.</p>


<p><b>Seven Deadly Sins.</b>&mdash;According to the teaching
of the Roman Catholic Church, these are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
as follows: (1) Pride, (2) Anger, (3) Envy,
(4) Sloth, (5) Lust, (6) Covetousness, (7)
Gluttony.</p>


<p><b>Seven Liberal Arts.</b>&mdash;A term applied during
the Middle Ages to the following branches of
learning: (1) Arithmetic, (2) Geometry, (3)
Astronomy, (4) Music, (5) Logic, (6) Rhetoric,
(7) Grammar.</p>


<p><b>Seven Spiritual Works of Mercy.</b>&mdash;According
to the teaching of the Roman Catholic
Church, these are as follows: (1) To admonish
the sinful, (2) to bear wrongs patiently,
(3) to comfort the afflicted, (4) to counsel the
doubting, (5) to forgive offenses, (6) to instruct
the ignorant, (7) to pray for the living
and the dead.</p>


<p><b>Seven Wise Men of Greece.</b>&mdash;Applied to
seven Greek sages, whose wisdom was embodied
in the following maxims: (1) Solon
of Athens, "Know thyself"; (2) Chilo of
Sparta, "Consider the end"; (3) Thales of
Miletus, "Suretyship brings ruin"; (4) Bias
of Priene, "Most men are bad"; (5) Cleobulus
of Lindus, "Avoid extremes"; (6)
Pittacus of Mitylene, "Know thine opportunity";
(7) Periander of Corinth, "Nothing is
impossible to industry."</p>


<p><b>Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages.</b>&mdash;(1)
The Coliseum at Rome, (2) the Catacombs of
Alexandria, (3) the Great Wall of China, (4)
the Leaning Tower of Pisa, (5) the Porcelain
Tower of Nanking, (6) the Mosque of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Sophia at Constantinople, (7) the Ruins of
Stonehenge.</p>


<p><b>Seven Wonders of the New World.</b>&mdash;(1)
Niagara Falls, (2) Yellowstone Park, (3)
Garden of the Gods, (4) Mammoth Cave, (5)
Yosemite Valley, (6) Giant Trees, (7) Natural
Bridge.</p>


<p><b>Seven Wonders of the World.</b>&mdash;In ancient
times generally regarded as follows: (1) The
Pyramids of Egypt, (2) the Hanging Gardens
of Babylon, (3) the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus,
(4) the Temple of Diana at Ephesus,
(5) the Colossus of Rhodes, (6) the Pharos at
Alexandria, (7) the Statue of the Olympian
Jove in Elis.</p>


<p><b>Shaving Lotions.</b>&mdash;Hot water applied to the
face after shaving removes much of the sting
or soreness, and the use of bay rum, hamamelis
or witch hazel, or almond cream, is to
be recommended. A very good shaving
preparation is made of equal parts of bay rum
and hamamelis.</p>

<p>The work on shipboard is done by watches,
the crew being mustered into two divisions,
known as the Starboard Watch and Port
Watch. The day begins at noon, and is divided
into: Afternoon Watch, noon to 4
P. M.; First Dog Watch, 4 P. M. to 6 P. M.;
Second Dog Watch, 6 P. M. to 8 P. M.; First
Watch, 8 P. M. to Midnight; Middle Watch,
12 A. M. to 4 A. M.; Morning Watch, 4 A. M.
to 8 A. M.; Forenoon Watch, 8 A. M. to noon.</p>


<p><b>Slavery.</b>&mdash;Slavery is of a prehistoric origin,
but was commercialized by the Romans, some
of whom had as many as 10,000 slaves. In
1834, the British Colonies emancipated nearly
800,000 slaves, and the Civil War wiped slavery
out of the United States. It does not now
exist in any civilized nation.</p>


<p><b>Soap.</b>&mdash;Many of the soaps upon the market
are impure and even dangerous, and never
should be used. Most of the standard white
soaps, however, are pure and may be used
freely. Cheap laundry soaps are not only
impure, but injure the hands; and many of
the highly perfumed soaps are hardly better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
than laundry soaps. Thoroughly good soap
can be purchased at retail for not exceeding
ten cents a cake, and for this price one can
obtain really all there is in soap. Medicated
soaps, except the antiseptic soaps recommended
by physicians, have little or no value. The
reader should purchase only the standard
grade of soaps, and should never pay more
than 25 cents a cake for any soap, because
any price in excess of 25 cents is for perfume
or represents exorbitant profit. Every physician
is familiar with soap quality, and will
gladly give you a list of reliable soaps without
charge. There is no such thing as a complexion
soap, except that all good soaps aid
the complexion. There is no soap safe to use
that removes pimples, or keeps pimples or
other skin troubles from coming. Soap has
only one value, and that is, its ability to assist
water in cleansing the skin, except the antiseptic
soaps, which may prevent contagion
and which should be used by all who enter
the sick-room. Ninety-nine per cent. of the
expensive soaps are no better, save for their
perfume, than soap sold at five or ten cents
a cake.</p>


<p class="ph3">Solar System</p>

<p>The Solar System, of which the earth is a
part, consists of eight planets and the sun, so
far as has been discovered. Astronomers have
located 465 asteroids, which are small bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
floating in space and with apparently established
orbits. From time to time, astronomers
claim to have discovered a new planet,
but its existence is not as yet accepted. The

club was known as the New York Knickerbockers,
which was organized in 1845, and the
first match game was played at Hoboken, N. J.,
in 1846. The first rules governing baseball
were made in New York City, in 1857, and the
National Baseball League was formed in New
York City during the same year. The first
champion team was that of New York, in
1858, but it was not until 1868 that a salaried
team was in existence. The National League
was formed in 1876, and the American League
in 1881. The largest attendance at a baseball

<p class="ph3">Standard Time</p>

<p>Until 1883, each city or district maintained
its own time, usually accepting what is known
as True Time. This condition caused complications.
For example: Many railroad-station
clocks either gave two times, or else there
were separate clocks for each time, some of
the trains leaving the station on what was
know as New York time, while others left
on local time. Banks and business houses
closed on either of the times. There was no
standard and no agreement.</p>

<p>In 1883, Standard Time was established.</p>

<p>The First Section was known as the Eastern,
and covered all territory between the Atlantic
Coast and a line drawn from Detroit,
Michigan, to Charleston, South Carolina.</p>

<p>The Central Section included everything between
the Detroit-Charleston line, and a line
drawn from Bismarck, North Dakota, to the
mouth of the Rio Grande River.</p>

<p>The Third Section, known as "Mountain
Time," included the territory between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Bismarck-Rio Grande line and the western
borders of Idaho, Utah, and Arizona.</p>

<p>The Pacific Time Section embraced everything
west of the Mountain Time line, up to
and including the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>There is a difference of just one hour between
the sections. When it is 12 o'clock at
Boston, Mass., or at New York City, it is 11
o'clock at Chicago, and at San Francisco 9
o'clock.</p>

<p>The changing from so-called Local or True
Time to Standard Time required clocks at
Boston to be set back 16 minutes; New York
clocks to be set back 4 minutes; Detroit clocks
to be set back 28 minutes; St. Louis clocks
to be moved ahead one minute; and San Francisco
clocks to be set ahead ten minutes.</p>

<p>Standard Time has been accepted by every
State and by practically every city, although
a very few cities and towns unprogressively
hold to the former or True Time. The Canadian
Pacific Railroad, which has the longest
mileage of any railroad in the world, is
run on what is known as the 24-Hour Time;
that is, the faces of its clocks, instead of bearing
the figures 1 to 12, run from 1 to 24 inclusive.
The time-tables are rather confusing,
as trains are billed to arrive and depart
at 13:10, 16:14, 23:30, etc. This system appears
to have only one advantage,&mdash;that it
eliminates the use of A. M. and P. M. It is
possible that it will be accepted elsewhere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and even generally, but not for the present.</p>


<p><b>Star Chamber.</b>&mdash;A tribunal, made up of a
committee of the King's Privy Council, instituted
or revived in 1486. It was supposed to
have almost unlimited powers and to be exempt
from any rules or law. It had the right
to inflict any form of punishment except death.
The term is now applied to assemblies or committees
or others who conduct their investigations
and decide upon questions in secret.</p>

<p><b>Star-Spangled Banner.</b>&mdash;The national song<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of the United States. Composed by Francis
Scott Key on the night of September 13, 1814.
"The cartel-ship <cite>Minden</cite> was anchored in
sight of Fort McHenry, and from her deck
Key saw, during the night of 13 Sept., 1814,
the bombardment of that fortress. It was
during the excitement of this attack, and while
pacing the deck of the <cite>Minden</cite> with intense
anxiety between midnight and dawn, that Key
composed the song. It was first written on
the back of a letter, and after his return to
Baltimore copied out in full."&mdash;Harper's

<p>There have appeared in public print, several

based upon Greek and other measurements.
It is probable that few of these tables are
authentic, and many of them are, undoubtedly,
incorrect. The following table is compiled by
Jay W. Seaver, M. D., for 20 years professor
at Yale University, and is as nearly correct
as possibility would admit. Dr. Seaver, however,
does not claim absolute correctness.
The second and third tables given are used
quite generally in civil service examinations
by local, state, and national governments, and
apply largely to those seeking positions on the
police force or the fire department</p>

<p><b>Steam Engine.</b>&mdash;The principle of the steam
engine is very simple. Stripped of all technicality,
it may be described as follows: Take
a can with a height somewhat longer than its
width, and close up both ends. Make a hole
in the center of one of the ends large enough
for the insertion of a rod about the diameter
of a small poker. Fasten one end of this rod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
to the center of a disc which will fit closely
into the can. Insert this disc in the can with
the poker passing through the hole. The
whole apparatus will be similar to that of a
churn. Bore two holes in the sides of the
can, at top and bottom. Allow steam to pass
into the can through the first hole, which will
force the disc to the other end of the can, and
draw the poker with it. Then, introduce
steam through the other hole. This will drive
the disc to the other end of the can, and at
the same time the steam entering the first
hole will pass out. This gives a motion to
the poker rod, which continues so long as
steam is forced in and out. The rod, is, of
course, connected with a crank which works
on a shaft, and from this shaft power is transmitted.
The steam is let into the cylinder automatically.
A fly wheel is maintained where
there is not more than one cylinder, and even
where there is more than one, so as to create
momentum, which carries the crank beyond
its dead center. The modern steam engine
makes from 100 to even 1,000 revolutions a
minute. Its power is measured by its capacity
to equal that of one or several horses, and is
known as horse-power. Steam engines are
made with a capacity of only a small fraction
of horse-power, and up to several thousand.
But usually, where great power is required,
more than one cylinder is used, all of them
working upon the same shaft The so-called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
turbine steam engine is similar to the ordinary
turbine water wheel, except that steam, instead
of water, is forced against it. See
"Turbines."</p>


<p><b>Strikes.</b>&mdash;The strike is an agreement upon
the part of workmen to refuse to work until
their demands are accepted. The first strike
in the United States took place in New York
City, in 1803, and was confined to sailors. In
1888, there were 697 strikes, involving over
210,000 employees. In 1886, the number of
strikes increased 52 per cent., and in 1888 the
increase was 22 per cent. In the early days
nearly half of the strikes were in Pennsylvania.
The great coal strike of 1902 was probably
the most disastrous and largest strike on
record. It involved about 150,000 men, with
a loss of wages of nearly $40,000,000.</p>


<p><b>Sub Rosa.</b>&mdash;The term "under the rose"
implies secrecy. It had its origin B. C. 477,
when Pausanias, commander of the fleet of
Spartans and Athenians, was intriguing with
Xerxes for the subjugation of Greece to Persia
and for the hand of the king's daughter in
marriage. The business was transacted in the
"Brazen House," the roof of which was a
garden making a bower of roses. Hence the
term Sub Rosa.</p>


<p><b>Sugar Industry.</b>&mdash;The United States consumes
each year nearly 3,500,000 tons of
sugar, or about 80 pounds per capita.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>


<p><b>Sunday Schools.</b>&mdash;The Sunday Schools of
the United States have a membership of about
15,500,000, including teachers. The Sunday
School membership of England and Wales is
over 7,000,000. Connected with the Sunday
Schools of the world are about 2,650,000 teachers
and 26,500,000 scholars.</p>


<p><b>Talking Machines.</b>&mdash;The talking machine,
known by several names, including the phonograph,
was originally invented by Edison.
Unscientifically speaking, it consists of a disc
similar to that used in the telephone, with a
needle or point attached to the center of the
underside of it. This needle or point fits into
circular or cylindrical grooves, which are covered
with tin foil or other malleable substance.</p>

<p>The vibrations of the voice or of music,
which reach the disc, cause this needle or
point to rise or fall, producing impressions
upon the tin foil or other substance. After
the record has been made, duplicates are produced
in a substance largely made of rubber,
which is placed on a rotary disc or cylinder
that is turned automatically, the needle or
point attached to the disc working into the
grooves and rising with or following the impressions,
which cause the plate or disc to vibrate.
The process is wholly mechanical,
and electricity is not used.</p>


<p><b>Tariff.</b>&mdash;This word, meaning a schedule of
duties on merchandise, imported or exported,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
is said to come from Tarifa, a town in Southern
Spain, on the Mediterranean Sea, where
duties were once levied by the Moors on all
ships passing in or out of the Straits of
Gibraltar.</p>


<p><b>Telegraph.</b>&mdash;The conception of the telegraph
came to Professor Morse, in 1832, while
he was making a voyage from Europe to
America, and he at once began his experiments,
which resulted in what may be considered
one of the two greatest inventions or discoveries.
After waiting about eight years,
Congress reluctantly appropriated a sum sufficient
to build a telegraph line between
Washington and Baltimore. The original
conception of telegraphy belongs wholly to
Professor Morse, but since its invention other
scientists have invented improvements, including
an apparatus which allows the sending
of two messages each way, or four messages
in all, over the same wire at the same
time. The telegraphic code or alphabet, originally
invented by Morse, remains practically
intact. It consists of dots and dashes, and
may be learned in a few hours, although expertness
requires a year or more of practice.
Unscientifically speaking, the telegraphic apparatus
is extremely simple: it consists primarily
of a piece of soft iron around which is
wound several strands of insulated wire. During
the time that electricity is passing through
this wire, the soft iron becomes a magnet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
but returns to its nonmagnetic character
when electricity is not passing around it. A
battery is used for the generating of electricity.
The operator turns electricity into the
wire by pressing a key. When the key is
down, the electricity passes around the piece
of soft iron and makes of it a magnet, which
will draw iron or steel to it, the same as does
any ordinary permanent magnet. Just above
the end of the soft iron is placed a piece of
metal, and as the key is pressed letting in the
electricity, the iron (then a magnet) draws
this metal to it, producing a slight sound or
click. This piece of iron is held by a spring,
and springs back into place when electricity
is let out of the insulated wire surrounding
the soft iron. If a message is to be sent a
long distance, a relay is used so as to turn
into the wire additional currents of electricity,
because electricity loses some of its strength
if carried over a very long wire, and a relay
adds new or fresh currents from separate batteries.
In this way, a message can be sent
continuously for several thousand miles, which
would be impossible without the use of relays.
The process of sending several messages at
the same time over the same wire is somewhat
complicated. The result is obtained by
using currents of electricity of different intensity,
the currents not interfering with each
other. The ocean cables are described under
another heading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>


<p><b>Telephone.</b>&mdash;The telephone is supposed to
have been invented by Professor A. G. Bell,
in 1875, but scientists recognize the probable
invention of it, largely in theory, by the eminent
scientists Dolbear, Gray, Edison, and
possibly others. It is exceedingly difficult to
describe, other than scientifically, the working
of the telephone; and it cannot be done perfectly
until electricity is fully understood. We
know the result, but are not able to locate all
of the causes. The original telephone consisted
of a bar of magnetized steel of about
the circumference of an ordinary poker, a few
inches in length, around which was wound insulated
wire. At one end of the magnet, and
close to it, was placed a metallic disc about
twice the circumference of a silver dollar and
of the thickness of thin tin. Originally the
same instrument was used both for sending
and for receiving. Any sound, including the
human voice, brought in direct contact with
the disc, caused it to vibrate, and for some unknown
reason these vibrations were transmitted
through the magnet, and by the wires carried
to another similar instrument. The
sounds and voice were carried a short distance
without the use of a battery, and the early
telephones had ground circuits; that is, there
was only one wire between the stations, the
other wire being grounded by being attached
to gas or other pipes, the electricity making
half the circuit through the earth. Later on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
a battery was used, which increased the sending
distances, but the ground wire remained
for some time. The present telephone consists
of the original telephone as a receiver,
but with a transmitter into which the sender
speaks his words. The mechanism of the
transmitter is complicated and cannot be described
except scientifically. Its use allows
one to talk long distances, even to the extent
of 2,000 miles. Non-technically speaking, then,
the telephone consists of a magnet, insulated
wire, and a disc, the vibration upon the disc
being transmitted over the wire from the
sending to the receiving station, electricity
being used for conveying the vibrations or
sound.</p>

<p>Eight billion, four hundred thousand and
twenty-seven million conversations were held
in this country last year over the wires of the
American Telephone and Telegraph Co., according
to its annual report. The daily average
was 26,310,000. The company now has
telephone stations in 70,000 cities, towns, and
hamlets, which is 5,000 more than the number
of postoffices in the country, and 10,000 more
than the number of railroad stations. Altogether
there were 7,456,074 telephone stations
of the company at the end of 1912.</p>


<p><b>Ten Great Religions.</b>&mdash;James Freeman
Clarke, in his book "Ten Great Religions,"
gives the following as the ten most important
faiths of ancient and modern times:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<ol>
<li>Confucianism.</li>
<li>Brahmanism.</li>
<li>Buddhism.</li>
<li>Zoroastrianism.</li>
<li>Religion of Egypt.</li>
<li>Religion of Greece and Rome.</li>
<li>Teutonic and Scandinavian Religion.</li>
<li>Judaism.</li>
<li>Christianity.</li>
<li>Islâm.</li>
</ol>


<p><b>Théâtre Français.</b>&mdash;The most famous theatre
in Paris, and, perhaps, in the world. It
is situated in the Place du Palais Royal, and
is the home of the Comédie Française. In
1900 it was destroyed by fire, but immediately
rebuilt. The original building was erected in
1782, but was later much altered.</p>


<p><b>Thunder.</b>&mdash;The sound of thunder is produced
by the sudden rush of the air into the
vacuum caused by the rapid passage of lightning
through the air.</p>


<p><b>Ticket-of-Leave.</b>&mdash;The English Government
in 1854 issued a permit which allowed a convict
his liberty before the expiration of his
term. It was necessary for him to report to
the police at stated times, and, if he committed
any crime, his ticket-of-leave was recalled.
The ticket-of-leave is similar to probation
granted in the United States.</p>


<p><b>Time Difference.</b>&mdash;When it is 12 o'clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
noon in New York City, it is 5:13 in Antwerp;
about 5:49 in Berlin; about 5:13 in
Brussels; about 1:02 in Buenos Ayres; about
10:49 in Calcutta; about 6:53 in Constantinople;
about 4:30 in Dublin; about 4:34 in
Liverpool; about 4:56 in London; about 5:05
in Paris; about 5:46 in Rome; about 6:57 in
St. Petersburg. When it is 12 o'clock noon in
New York City, it is 33-1/2 minutes earlier in
Havana; about 11 hours and 28 minutes earlier
in Hong Kong; about 9 hours and 24 minutes
earlier in Melbourne; about 9 hours and
45-1/2 minutes earlier in Yokohama.</p>


<p><b>Tobacco Industry.</b>&mdash;The United States
grows about 905,000,000 pounds of tobacco a
year, and over a million acres are used for
growing tobacco. The value of the tobacco
grown each year is about $85,000,000.</p>


<p><b>To Estimate the Weight of Hay.</b>&mdash;Find the
length, breadth, and depth of the hay, in feet,
and multiply these three dimensions together;
if the hay is on the wagon or newly stored,
divide the product by 540; but if it is well
settled in the mow or stack, divide by 512. If
the hay is baled, 270 cubic feet will weigh a
ton. The number of cubic feet in a circular
stack is found by multiplying the average circumference
in yards by itself and this product
by four times the height of the stack in yards;
then point off the two right-hand figures and
multiply the result by 27.</p>


<p><b>To Find Length of Day or Night.</b>&mdash;At any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
time of the year add 12 hours to the time of
the sun's setting, and from the sum subtract
the time of rising for the length of the day.
Subtract the time of setting from 12 hours,
and to the remainder add the time of rising
next morning for the length of the night.
These rules are equally true for apparent
time.</p>


<p><b>To Measure Corn in the Crib.</b>&mdash;Find the
length, breadth, and depth of the corn, in feet,
and multiply these three dimensions together;
this product multiplied by .63 will give the
number of heaped bushels in the ear. Sometimes
one and one-half bushels of ears make
a bushel of shelled corn, and sometimes it requires
two bushels, the amount required depending
upon the size of the cob, shape of
the ear, etc.</p>


<p><b>Tom Thumb.</b>&mdash;Tom Thumb was probably
the most famous dwarf in the world, not because
of the absence of others of the same
height, or less, but because he was exploited
by the late P. T. Barnum. Tom Thumb,
whose real name was Charles S. Stratton, was
born in 1838, and died in 1883. In 1842 he was
two feet in height and weighed sixteen pounds.
In 1863 his height increased to thirty-one
inches, and later to forty inches.</p>

<p><b>Trade Unions.</b>&mdash;The trade union, although
supposed to be of modern origin, was established
as early as 1548. Mythical history
which, of course, cannot be authenticated, indicates
the possibility of an organization of
working men at the time of the building of
Solomon's temple. During the last several
years, trade unionism has grown to enormous
proportions, and practically every vocation has
its union or organization. The right to organize
is self-evident, so long as it does not
restrain trade or interfere with personal
rights. The employee and employer certainly
have legal and moral rights to do as they
please, provided they do not interfere with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
legal or moral law, and do not use coercion.
Moral influence, however, cannot be criticised.
The maintenance of a well-organized labor
union is to the advantage of both capital and
labor, and should be encouraged. Naturally,
the binding together of laborers or workmen,
and that of capital, causes some abuses, for
humanity, as it runs, is not always fair; but
one should not criticise either side without
criticising the other. Both have their advantages
and disadvantages, both are fair and unfair.
As civilization progresses, the mistakes
and abuses will be corrected, and organized
labor and capital will work in harmony.</p>


<p><b>Trusts.</b>&mdash;A trust is an association of capitalists,
organized for the purpose of controlling
any one trade or trades. It is illegal and
may be punished by imprisonment or fine.
It is exceedingly difficult, however, to discover
whether or not an organization is in actual
restraint of trade, and to prosecute a combination.
Undoubtedly trusts exist in America,
and all over the world for that matter, and are
illegal. Great effort is being made to disband
them, but so far has very little real effect,
for most of the trusts which are disorganized
by law continue in some other form.</p>


<p><b>Turbines.</b>&mdash;The turbine has largely taken
the place of the water wheel, because it is
more compact, produces greater energy, and
is more powerful. It is, untechnically speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>ing,
a box containing a series of fanlike blades
set at an angle, so that water or steam brought
against them will make them turn.</p>


<p><b>Type.</b>&mdash;Movable metallic type was invented
by Gutenberg, of Germany, about 1450. Before
this time, all books and papers were either
hand-written or printed from engraved wooden
blocks. To-day there are over 50,000 faces
and sizes of type. Type is divided into three
great classes: (1) Roman or body type, which
is used for the reading matter in newspapers,
magazines, and books; (2) display type, which
appears in headings, and is used for circulars
and the like; and (3) ornamental type, which
has a fancy face. The different sizes of type
formerly bore arbitrary names, like Nonpareil,
Pica, etc., but now all type is under the point
system, Nonpareil being known as 6 Point
and Pica as 12 Point. The reading matter
in all large daily newspapers is set in 6 Point,
but most books are printed from either 10, 11,
or 12 Point. Twelve Point type has twice
the depth of 6 Point type. Type to be set is
placed in two cases, one known as upper case
and the other as lower case, the former holding
capitals and small capitals; the latter
small letters and figures, both cases containing
boxes for spaces and other characters.
The compositor holds in his left hand what is
known as a composing stick, or stick. It is
made of metal, with a bottom and three sides,
the left side being movable and adjustable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
The compositor places one piece of type at a
time in the stick, setting the type from left
to right and upside down. He places metal
spaces between each word. When a line is
completed, he sets another, with or without a
piece of thin metal between the lines, known
as a lead. When the stick is full, he dumps
his type into a galley, which is a receptacle
made of wood or metal, from one to three feet
long, framed at the bottom and at the sides,
but open at the other end. The type is then
locked up in a steel frame or chase, and is
ready to be stereotyped, electrotyped, or to be
printed from.</p>


<p><b>United States Flag.</b>&mdash;On June 14, 1777, the
United States Congress declared "that the
flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen
stripes, alternate red and white; that the
Union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field,
representing the new constellation." In 1794
Congress decreed that after May 1st, 1795,
"The flag of the United States be fifteen
stripes, alternate red and white, and that the
Union be fifteen stars, white in a blue field."
At that time the stars and stripes were of
equal number, and it was the intention to add
both a star and stripe with the addition of each
new State. Subsequently, it was found that
the addition of a stripe for each new State
would produce a flag altogether too large.
Accordingly, Congress, on April 4th, 1818, reduced
the number of stripes to thirteen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
made the number of stars twenty, that being
the number of States at that time. It was
further enacted that a new star should be
added as each new State was admitted into
the Union. By act of Congress, the flag has
become a sacred emblem, and cannot be used
for other than decorative or patriotic purposes,
and cannot serve as a part of an advertisement
or other announcement.</p>

<p><b>University Extension.</b>&mdash;A scheme for extending
to people at large the advantages of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
a university education, by means of courses
of lectures and classes in various important
cities. The scheme originated at the University
of Cambridge, England, in 1872, and was
introduced into the United States in 1890.</p>


<p><b>University Settlements.</b>&mdash;Homes established
in the poorer parts of cities, where educated
and cultured people may live and try to improve
the lives of their neighbors. Lectures,
studies, and various other devices are resorted
to. The movement started in England in
1867, and appeared in New York in 1887, as
a "Neighborhood Guild." University settlements
are now found in all the chief cities of
the United States.</p>


<p><b>Utopia.</b>&mdash;An imaginary island, with an ideal
commonwealth, the inhabitants of which enjoy
perfect laws and institutions. It is described
in Sir Thomas More's political romance, "De
Optimo Reipublicae Statu, deque Nova Insula
Utopia," published in Latin in 1516, and translated
into English in 1551. His purpose was
to describe his idea of social arrangements by
which the people's most absolute happiness
and improvement might be secured.</p>


<p><b>Vaccination.</b>&mdash;Vaccination, a preventive of
smallpox, was discovered by Dr. Edward
Jenner of England. It consists of injecting
into the blood a virus made from the sores or
scabs of cows suffering from cowpox, or the
virus may be taken from the sore coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
from vaccination itself. Comparatively few
people, properly vaccinated, can have the
smallpox, and are largely exempt from any
disease resembling it, except that which is
known as varioloid, which is a mild form of
smallpox. It is not known how long vaccination
remains a preventive, but probably for
seven years, when one should be vaccinated
again. The prejudice against vaccination,
which was very intense at its discovery, no
longer exists except among a few. Practically
every physician advocates it, and it is
compulsory in some towns and cities. Deaths
have occurred from it, but they are very infrequent.</p>


<p><b>Vacuum.</b>&mdash;The perfect vacuum, which it is
impossible to produce, is space without air or
atmosphere. Vacuums are made by pumping
all the air out of a receptacle or chamber.
In a vacuum, everything falls at the same
rapidity, as there is nothing to buoy it up,
a feather descending as rapidly as lead shot.</p>


<p><b>Vedas.</b>&mdash;Sacred writings of the Hindus,
hymns, prayers, and liturgies, said to have
been compiled by Vyasa about 1200 B. C.
They are written in Sanskrit, and divided into
four parts.</p>


<p><b>Voodooism.</b>&mdash;A degraded form of religion
prevalent among the negroes of Hayti and the
Southern States of America. Supposed to be
a relic of the religion of equatorial Africa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>


<p><b>Watered Stock.</b>&mdash;It is said that the late
Commodore Vanderbilt originated what is
known as watered stock. Watered stock is
capitalizing an industry at a figure in advance
of its real value. For example: a railroad
has tangible assets of $10,000,000, and an earning
capacity sufficient to pay a 6 per cent. dividend
on its capitalization; financial giants
manipulate the stock and increase it to, say,
$20,000,000, watering it to the extent of 100
per cent. In other words, the real value of
the stock then is one-half of what it was in
the first place. Stock watering has become
epidemic, and is the cause of hundreds of
thousands of financial failures. The stock
waterers, however, as a rule, win, the public
being the victims.</p>


<p><b>Wealth of the Nations.</b>&mdash;The estimated

60-1/2; Russia, 40; Austria-Hungary, 25; Italy,

Portugal, 2.5; Switzerland, 2.4.</p>


<p class="ph3">Weather Flags</p>

<p>The Weather Bureau maintained by the
United States Department of Agriculture displays
at its stations flags which indicate probable
changes in the weather.</p>

<p>A white flag indicates clear or fair weather.</p>

<p>A blue flag, rain or snow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>A flag with the upper half white and the
lower half blue, local rain or snow.</p>

<p>A black triangular flag indicates temperature.</p>

<p>A white flag with black square in center,
a cold wave.</p>

<p>When the black triangular flag is placed
above the white flag, the black flag or the
white and blue flag, it indicates warmer
weather; when below, colder.</p>

<p>When the black triangular flag is not displayed
at all, the temperature is likely to remain
stationary.</p>

<p>Flags are displayed by the Weather Bureau
as storm warnings in the following manner:</p>

<p>Small Craft Warning: A red pennant indicates
that moderately strong winds are expected.</p>

<p>Storm Warning: A red flag with a black
center indicates that a storm of marked violence
is expected.</p>

<p>The pennants displayed with the flags indicate
the direction of the wind&mdash;white, westerly
(from southwest to north); red, easterly
(from northeast to south). The pennant above
the flag indicates that the wind is expected to
blow from the northerly quadrants; below,
from the southerly quadrants.</p>

<p>By night a red light indicates easterly winds,
and a white light below a red light, westerly
winds.</p>

<p>Hurricane Warning: Two red flags with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
black centers, displayed one above the other,
indicate the expected approach of a tropical
hurricane, or one of those extremely severe
and dangerous storms which occasionally
move across the Lakes and Northern Atlantic
coast.</p>

<p>No night small craft or hurricane warnings
are displayed.</p>

<p class="ph3">WHAT TO DO IN EMERGENCIES</p>

<p>Many books and pamphlets have been written
advising the layman what to do in a case
of emergency, and in the absence of a physician
or surgeon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Much of the information presented is altogether
too technical, and is not likely to be
understood by the public at large.</p>

<p>The author has attempted to cover, in a few
pages, the fundamentals of first aid to the
injured, and has carefully avoided technical
and medicinal terms. No amount of information,
no matter how carefully or plainly
written, can take the place of the physician
or surgeon. Self-doctoring and -dosing is, or
should be, considered a crime, and no one is
justified in attempting to relieve any one suffering
from accident or any other ailment, if
it is of possible seriousness, unless a good
physician or surgeon cannot be procured.</p>

<p>First and always, keep your head, and keep
cool. Don't get excited. Work rapidly, but
deliberately. If the injury or trouble is at all
serious, summon a surgeon or physician immediately.
If you are alone with the sufferer,
it may not be safe for you to leave him, but
unless he is in immediate danger, it is better
to call a competent physician, even though
you have to absent yourself from him for a
few moments. If the accident occurs in a
crowd, solicit some one who looks trustworthy,
and request him to telephone or
otherwise communicate with a doctor.</p>

<p>If you know the cause of the accident or
trouble inform the physician in advance, so
that he may be better prepared to meet it
and bring with him instruments and remedies.</p>

<p>The patient or sufferer should be placed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
a comfortable position, a doctor or surgeon
summoned, and in the interval the layman
may follow the instructions presented here.
If he does so, no harm will be done, and in
many cases suffering will be relieved, and
death or serious illness prevented. But the
author again, and most emphatically, urges
the layman to send for a physician or surgeon,
and to follow the instructions or information
given in this chapter only as preliminary to
the arrival of the doctor or surgeon, unless
the injury be of slight consequence.</p>

<p>If possible, remove the patient to a quiet
place, where there is plenty of air, and where
the temperature is normal.</p>

<p>If there are many people about, request them
to keep away.</p>

<p>Place the injured person in a comfortable
position, usually upon his back, and straighten
out his legs and arms. If the head is injured,
better lift it above the level of the body; but
if it is not, allow the body to lie on a level.</p>

<p>If the patient is breathing hard, it may be
well to lift him into a sitting position. Loosen
his collar, waist-band, and clothing. If he
faints, his head should be slightly lower than
his feet. If an arm or leg is injured, lift it
slightly and place it upon a cushion, pillow,
or other support.</p>

<p>If the one injured is unconscious, watch
him very carefully. If he is vomiting, or that
tendency is apparent, turn him over on one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
side so that the discharge will run out easily
and not go into the lungs.</p>

<p>If he is wounded, cut away the clothing
covering the wound, but don't remove any
more than is necessary. If he has been
burned, pour lukewarm water, containing a
little saleratus or bicarbonate of soda, over
the clothing before you remove it. If he is
bleeding severely, stop the bleeding before
dressing the wound. After the wound is
dressed there is nothing for the novice to do,
except bring the patient to consciousness, if
unconscious, and remove him to a place of
safety and comfort.</p>

<p>If the accident or injury be serious, or the
patient is unconscious, it is well to request
more than one bystander to summon a physician,
because the first one sent may fail, or
the physician he telephones to or calls upon
may be unavailable.</p>

<p>Use the telephone, if there is one at hand
or nearby, and tell the physician what you
think is the matter with the sufferer or what
caused the accident, that he may be better
prepared to bring with him the instruments
necessary.</p>

<p>If you are alone with the patient, and cannot
notify a physician or surgeon without
leaving the patient, you must use your best
judgment; but you should make every possible
effort to reach a physician at the earliest
possible moment. Remain with the patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
long enough to place him in a comfortable
position, and to stop the flow of blood, if
bleeding; then make all haste to notify a
physician or surgeon.</p>

Conn., and recently of Yale University.</p>


<p><b>Accidents.</b>&mdash;Convey the sufferer to a place
of safety, and give him plenty of air. If a
shock follows, follow instructions given for
shock. Do not touch the wound with the bare
hand. Wear absolutely clean gloves or wrap
the fingers in clean cloth or gauze. Do not
attempt to cleanse the wound. Summon a
surgeon immediately.</p>


<p><b>Apparent Death.</b>&mdash;Never assume that a
person is dead because he appears to be.
Summon a physician. A fairly good test of
death is to hold the hand of the person apparently
dead before a candle or other light,
with the fingers stretched out, each touching
the other. Gaze intently between the fingers,
and if the person is alive, a red or pink color
will undoubtedly be seen where the fingers
touch each other. Another method is to take
a cold piece of polished steel, like a razor
blade or table knife, and hold before the
mouth or nose of the person apparently dead.
If moisture does not gather on it, it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
safe to assume that breathing has stopped;
but these tests are not infallible.</p>


<p><b>Bandaging.</b>&mdash;There are two kinds of bandages,&mdash;the
roller bandage or the triangular or
handkerchief bandage. They may be purchased
at any drug store or be made on the
spot in an emergency. The purchased bandages
are made of gauze, or muslin, crinolin,
elastic webbing, rubber, or other material.
The roller bandages are absorbent, and are
very thin and pliable. They should be placed
next to the wound and hold the fluids. Muslin
bandages are stronger than those made of
gauze, and should be used for pressure and
outside bandages. Bandages should be kept
in a perfectly clean place, and always covered,
either by being enclosed in a box or wrapped
in paper. If an improvised bandage is used,
care should be taken to use a clean cloth.
The triangular bandage is made by cutting a
piece of cloth about 36 inches square into two
pieces diagonally. It can be purchased at a
drug store, or any clean cloth can be used if
it is of firm texture.</p>


<p><b>Baths.</b>&mdash;Cold baths may be taken to reduce
fever and in sunstroke and other cases when
the temperature is high. It is well to have
the temperature in the bath at 70° or 80°
Fahrenheit, and to reduce the water until it
reaches 60° or 65°. Tepid baths have a temperature
of 80° or 90°, and warm baths are
of a temperature from 90° to a little less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
100°. Hot baths may be used in case of
shock, apparent drowning, depression, and
similar troubles. The temperature of the
water should vary from 98° to 110°. When
the patient leaves the bath, he should be dried
quickly and put to bed. Hot baths may produce
fainting, and should be taken in the
presence of an attendant. Do not guess at
the temperature of the water; use a thermometer.</p>


<p><b>Bleeding.</b>&mdash;Arterial blood, or blood coming
from the arteries, is bright red, and is discharged
in spurts or jets. Such bleeding is
very dangerous, and unless a physician arrives
almost immediately the patient is not
likely to survive.</p>

<p>Venous blood, which comes from the veins,
is of dark purple color and flows freely and
steadily.</p>

<p>Capillary bleeding comes from injured
small veins. It flows slowly, and such bleeding
is dangerous only if it continues. Always
summon a surgeon or physician, and put in a
hurry call for him. Force the patient to lie
down in a level position, preferably upon his
back.</p>

<p>If the leg or arm is wounded, elevate it.
Cut away the clothing quickly, so that it may
be exposed. Press the bleeding places, but
cover your finger with gauze or a clean handkerchief,
or compress the part by using a
strong cloth bandage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>If the bleeding comes from an artery, cover
your finger with a few thicknesses of gauze
or clean cloth, and press hard upon the
wound and maintain the pressure, which may
stop the bleeding. If the wound is large,
crowd a lot of gauze into it, and push it in,
then press on the flesh a little distance above
the wound, that is, between the wound and
the heart. This can be done by winding a
bandage, a piece of rubber tubing, string, or
rope, or a pair of suspenders may be used,
above the wound.</p>

<p>If the arm or leg is crushed, do not press on
the wound, but bring pressure to bear above
it.</p>


<p><b>Bleeding from the Veins.</b>&mdash;Lay a piece of
gauze over the wound and bind it on with a
firm bandage. Be very careful not to apply
your naked fingers or hand to the wound unless
you have washed them in some antiseptic,
but even then it is better to cover your fingers
with clean gauze or cloth. If the bleeding is
very severe, apply cracked ice wrapped in
gauze, and hard pressure below the wound.
Varicose veins occasionally bleed. Elevate
the arm or leg and bandage it very tightly,
the bandage to be placed directly over the
bleeding spot.</p>


<p><b>Bleeding from Capillary Veins.</b>&mdash;As the
blood oozes, and does not flow rapidly, expose
the wound to the air for a short time, which
will usually check it. The application of hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
water is advisable, but warm water should
not be used. Extremely cold water or cracked
ice will stop some bleeding. If copious bleeding
occurs around a tooth, it may be stopped
by packing the place with plaster of Paris,
or absorbent cotton may be used. In every
case, keep the places warm. After the bleeding
is stopped, give hot drinks, like hot tea,
coffee, or milk, if much blood has been lost.</p>


<p><b>Broken Bones.</b>&mdash;Do not attempt to set the
break. Handle the patient carefully. Place
him in a comfortable position and undress
him, removing the clothing by cutting it to
save time. If it is necessary to carry him a
distance, improvise a splint made of wood or
heavy pasteboard and fasten it around the
broken part with bandages. Carry him to a
physician or summon one at once, but let him
lie quietly if a physician can reach him. It is
well to have two splints, one on each side, to
be held in place by the same bandages. If
the arm is broken, bandage it and place it in
a sling. In every case, summon a physician
or carry the patient to one.</p>


<p><b>Chilblains.</b>&mdash;Keep the feet warm and dry.
Don't warm them at a fire or place them in
hot water, but bathe them in cold water and
rub with a dry towel. Apply turpentine, camphorated
spirits, or oil of wintergreen.</p>


<p class="ph3">Cleanliness</p>

<p>It is said that cleanliness is next to godli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>ness.
Good health is dependent upon the care
of the body, and the body will not remain in
a healthful state unless frequently bathed.</p>

<p>The fact that thousands of persons enjoy
good health without even taking an infrequent
bath, must not be used as an argument
against regular bathing. These persons, if in
health, live out of doors, and Nature seems
to take care of them; but it is obvious that
they would be healthier and stronger if they
gave proper attention to bodily cleanliness.</p>

<p>The majority of city dwellers, and a large
proportion of those living in the country,
work indoors, and their health is dependent
upon their personal cleanliness.</p>

<p>Opinions differ, and some hygienists do not
consider the daily bath essential, but the majority
of those who have studied the subject
maintain that perfect health requires the daily
bathing of the entire body.</p>

<p>Without the daily bath one does not begin
his work refreshed or with exhilaration.</p>

<p>A scrub is not to be recommended more
than once a week, but a bath should be taken
daily, and the entire body rubbed with a dry
towel, a bath towel to be preferred. Emersion
in a tub of water is not necessary, although
it is the best and easiest way of taking
a bath, next to a shower bath. A sponge bath
answers all purposes.</p>

<p>A cold plunge should not be taken without
the advice of a physician. The shower bath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
is very refreshing. A hot bath is seldom
advisable. It is better to have the water of
a temperature not much higher than that of
summer heat. A pure soap should be used,
and care should be taken to rinse it from the
body. The daily bath is the best preventive
of colds. Comparatively few people who
bathe daily suffer from more than transient
colds.</p>

<p>The bath should not be taken in a draught.
If the room is cold, work rapidly and use
additional time for rubbing, continuing it until
the skin glows.</p>

<p>The practice of partial bathing is not to be
recommended. When you take a bath, take
it all over.</p>

<p>If away from home, and sleeping in a hotel
bed, which may have been occupied by a diseased
person, it is well to go over the body
carefully in the morning with an antiseptic
soap. Every hotel, and all public conveyances,
are laden with germs, and a bath will
prevent many diseases.</p>

<p>A few drops of ammonia or a teaspoonful
of borax placed in the water in which you
bathe will remove the odor of perspiration,
but ammonia should not take the place of
good soap.</p>


<p><b>Clothing Afire.</b>&mdash;Force the person afire to
lie down and roll him over and over. Wrap
him in a rug or blanket, or anything else at
hand. Throw water upon him, but do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
wait for water. Wrapping him in a blanket
is sure to extinguish the flames. Under no
circumstances allow the person afire to run
about or out of doors.</p>


<p><b>Colds.</b>&mdash;Use simple remedies, such as hot
lemonade, but if the cold does not soon abate,
consult a physician.</p>


<p><b>Diphtheria.</b>&mdash;Consult your physician.
Never go near a case of diphtheria or allow
a dog, cat, or other animal to enter the sick-room.
Be careful of every utensil, and do not
allow any one else to use them until they
have been washed in antiseptics. Never handle
any clothing or other articles in a sick-room.</p>


<p class="ph3">Disinfectants</p>

<p>The reader is warned against placing reliance
upon any disinfectant, because it smells
of carbolic acid, or has any other strong odor.
Many of the advertised disinfectants are
worthless, and some of them are merely
deodorizers, which destroy smell and don't
disinfect.</p>

<p>Sulphur or brimstone is probably the best
fumigator. Sulphite of iron (copperas) is
cheap and should be used for sewers and
drains. Dissolve a pound and a half in a
gallon of water. Two parts of sulphate of
zinc to one part of common salt, dissolved in
a gallon of water, is a good disinfectant for
clothing, bed linen, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Carbolic acid is an excellent disinfectant,
but is efficacious only when used at considerable
strength, 3 to 5 per cent. Its strong
odor suggests qualities which do not exist,
if it is much diluted.</p>

<p>There are many disinfectants upon the
market, many of them being advertised to be
efficacious. Some of them are thoroughly reliable,
but others are almost worthless. I
would advise the reader not to purchase or
use a disinfectant which is not recommended
by a reliable physician.</p>


<p><b>Disinfecting Cellars, Yards, Cesspools, etc.</b>&mdash;Use
a solution made of 60 pounds of copperas
dissolved in a barrel of water. Sprinkle
freely over cellar and put a pailful in a cesspool.</p>


<p><b>Disinfecting the Sick-Room.</b>&mdash;Plenty of
fresh air and cleanliness are to be first considered.
The clothing, bed linen, and towels
should be washed in a tub containing a zinc
chloride solution, and the water should be
boiling hot. A solution of copperas and water
should be immediately placed in all vessels
containing discharges.</p>


<p><b>Dislocations.</b>&mdash;The novice should never attempt
to treat a dislocation. All he can do
is to place the patient in a comfortable position,
using a sling or cushion to support the
part injured. A physician should be summoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>


<p><b>Dog Bites.</b>&mdash;Wash the wound with antiseptic
soap or pure soap and water, with borax
dissolved in it to the strength of a teaspoonful
to a pint. Hydrophobia occurs very infrequently,
and many dogs, supposed to be mad,
are suffering from some other ailment; but a
surgeon should be summoned in all cases
whenever it is possible to do so. The bite of
a rat, cat, or other animal is not generally
dangerous, but the wound should be washed
with borax and water, as above. Better summon
a surgeon. Suck the wound vigorously
before applying washes. There is no danger
to the person sucking a wound of this nature,
unless the skin on his lips or in his mouth is
cracked or bleeding, but he may wash his
mouth with borax water if he feels uneasy
about it.</p>


<p class="ph3">Drowning</p>

<p>If the person is conscious tell him that you
will save him, which will prevent him from
losing his nerve. If you swim out for
him, and he is struggling, seize him by
the hair and turn him over on his back.
Swim on your side, towing him along as
you would a log of wood. You may hold
his head with one arm, but do not attempt
to support his entire body. If he struggles
violently, hold his head under water until
he is unconscious, so that you can better
handle him. Loosen his clothing, drain water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
out of lungs by inverting body, clean out his
mouth, and pull his tongue forward. Immediately
begin artificial respiration, each movement
to last from four to five seconds. Apply
warmth and rubbing, and when he is conscious
give him hot water, coffee, or lemonade.
Artificial breathing is of greatest consequence.
Do not give up. Many persons
have been resuscitated after many hours of
incessant labor. Artificial respiration may be
performed in the following way:</p>

<p>First&mdash;Immediately loosen the clothing
about the neck and chest, exposing them to
the wind, except in very severe weather. Get
the water out of the body, first by tickling
throat with a feather, or applying ammonia
to the nose; give a severe slap with the open
hand upon the chest and soles of feet; if no
immediate result, proceed as follows:</p>

<p>Second&mdash;Lay the body down in the open
air with the head hanging down and with its
weight on the stomach across any convenient
object, such as a keg, box, boat timber, or
your knees. Open the mouth quickly, drawing
the tongue forward with handkerchief or
cloth to let the water escape. Keep the mouth
clear of liquid. To relieve the pressure on
the stomach, roll the body gently from side to
side and then back on the stomach. Do this
several times to force the water from the
stomach and throat.</p>

<p>Third&mdash;Lay the body on the back, make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
roll of a coat or any garment, place it under
the shoulders of the patient, allowing the head
to fall back. Then kneel at the head of the
patient.</p>

<p>Open patient's mouth and place some small
object between teeth.</p>

<p>With tongue pliers or fingers covered with
gauze or cloth, grasp his tongue and draw it
out. Tie it down to his chin with cloth or
rubber band.</p>

<p>Grasp the patient's arms at the middle of
the forearms, fold them across his stomach,
and raise them over his head to a perpendicular
position, drawing them backward,
straight, then forward overhead to the sides
again, pressing the arms on the lower part of
the ribs and side, so as to produce a bellows
movement upon the lungs. Do this about
fifteen times a minute.</p>

<p>Apply smelling salts, camphor, or ammonia
to the nostrils to excite breathing.</p>

<p>Fourth&mdash;On signs of life, or when breathing
is restored, remove the clothing, dry the
body, wrap the patient in warm blankets or
hot cloths. To encourage circulation briskly
rub his limbs under the blankets toward the
heart; brandy or aromatic spirits of ammonia
may be given in small doses, with care to
avoid strangulation.</p>


<p class="ph3">Another Method</p>

<p>Another simple method of restoring breath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>ing,
one that is being rapidly adopted, is that
known as the Schafer, or prone, method. It
has the great advantage that it can be performed
by one man alone. This method has
just been endorsed as the preferable one by
a commission representing the American Medical
Association, the National Electric Light
Association, and the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers.</p>

<p>First&mdash;Lay patient on stomach with his
head to side and withdraw his tongue, which
itself then will hang out if teeth are held
apart with small object. The operator then
kneels astride the patient's thighs and with
his hands across the lower ribs swings his
body back and forth rhythmically, pausing
about two seconds as his weight falls upon
and is removed from patient. This movement
is to be continued at the rate of about fifteen
times a minute.</p>


<p><b>To Prevent Drowning.</b>&mdash;The human body
weighs, in the water, about one pound; that
is, it is approximately one pound heavier than
the water which it displaces. A stool, chair,
or small box or board will overcome the tendency
to sink and will keep the head above
water. The feet, and the hand which is not
clinging to an object, should be used as paddles.
Every one should learn to swim. If he
can take only a few strokes, the chances of
death by drowning are small, for he is likely
to be able to reach something which will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
support him. So much do I believe in the
necessity of knowing how to swim, that I
consider it a crime not to understand this art.</p>


<p><b>Electrical Accidents.</b>&mdash;Immediately shut off
the current, but do not handle the wire with
your naked hands. If rubber gloves are not
handy, cut the wire with an ax or knife, with
a piece of woolen cloth wrapped around the
handle. If you pull the sufferer away from
the wire, do not touch him with your bare
hands, but cover them with woolen cloth, or
wear rubber or woolen gloves, or remove him
by the use of a rope. The ordinary electric
shock will not cause death unless the patient
continues to receive it. Summon a doctor at
once. Place the patient in the open air, with
something under his shoulders. Loosen his
clothing, open his mouth, and pull out the
tongue. Clear the mouth from saliva. Force
air into his lungs by pressing the base of the
ribs about once in four seconds, then attempt
to resuscitate him as you would a drowning
person.</p>


<p><b>Emergencies with Children.</b>&mdash;If the child
suddenly suffers from vomiting, purging, and
prostration, send for a doctor at once. In the
meantime place him in a hot bath and then
carefully dry him with a warm towel and
wrap in warm blankets. If the hands and feet
are cold, apply hot water bottles to the feet
and hands. A poultice made of flaxseed meal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
(3/4) and mustard (1/4) should be placed over
the body. Five drops of brandy in a teaspoonful
of water may be given every 15
minutes. For sudden diarrh&oelig;a, administer one
teaspoonful of castor oil or of spiced syrup of
rhubarb. Allow the child to drink freely of
cold water that has been boiled. Always
summon a physician.</p>


<p class="ph3">Emergency Medicines ..</p>

<p>The writer would emphatically discourage
self-medication and dosing, and would oppose
the taking of medicines of any kind, except
the simplest remedies, without the advice of
a physician. Hundreds of thousands of people
have been made sick, because the wrong
medicine was administered to them, and
many more have taken medicine when they
didn't need it.</p>

<p>The following emergency medicines are
presented, with a distinct understanding that
they should not be used except in simple
cases:</p>


<p><b>Ammonia.</b>&mdash;What is known as ammonia
water, or liquor of ammonia, or as spirits of
hartshorn, or hartshorn, is of several strengths
and is highly irritating and poisonous if taken
internally. Applied externally, if of considerable
strength, it will cause blisters and pain.
Ammonia should not be applied to an open
wound or irritated surface, except in case of
snake bites or stings of insects, where it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
intended to neutralize the poisons. The vapor
of ammonia water, inhaled through the nostrils,
affects the nervous system and may be
used in fainting or epilepsy, but always with
caution, for a strong preparation of ammonia
applied to the nose may produce a violent
shock. It is better to saturate a handkerchief
or wad of cotton and hold it a short distance
from the nostrils. The buyer is cautioned
against the use of the strongest ammonia
water.</p>


<p><b>Aromatic Spirits of Ammonia.</b>&mdash;This is a
stimulant, and may be used in cases of sick
headache, hysteria, cholic, or fainting, in
doses of from 10 to 30 drops in sweetened
water.</p>


<p><b>Arnica.</b>&mdash;Tincture of arnica is supposed to
be of value in accidents, and especially efficacious
for sprains and bruises. It has some
value, mainly from the alcohol it contains and
partly because it is applied with friction. It
is a poison, and never should be taken internally.
For external use it should not be applied
at full strength, as it is apt to cause
inflammation if the skin is tender.</p>


<p><b>Bicarbonate of Soda.</b>&mdash;Bicarbonate of soda,
commonly known as baking soda or saleratus,
is distinct from sal soda or washing soda. It
is of great value in the treatment of burns,
and may be used as an antidote in poisoning
by acids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>


<p><b>Camphor.</b>&mdash;Camphor is purchased in gum
or in liquid form. It never should be taken
internally, except by advice of a physician.
Nor should it be applied in its full strength
directly to the wounds or to irritated or inflamed
surfaces.</p>


<p><b>Ginger.</b>&mdash;The essence or extract of ginger
is a very popular remedy for trouble with
the digestive organs, bowel complaints, etc.,
and should be taken in doses of from 10 to
40 drops in sweetened water, milk, or other
liquid. It never should be used habitually,
because it may establish a drug habit; nor
should large doses be taken to check diarrh&oelig;a,
as it is often inadvisable to too rapidly check
the discharges.</p>


<p><b>Glycerin.</b>&mdash;Glycerin may be used for burns,
and, mixed with equal parts of rose water, it
is a good lotion for chapped hands or lips,
but it is irritating to the skin of some people.</p>


<p><b>Peppermint.</b>&mdash;The essence of peppermint
may be used for stomach-ache and bowel complaints,
the usual dose being from 10 to 20
drops on sugar or in sweetened water. Oil
of peppermint should not be taken, except
when prescribed by a physician.</p>


<p><b>Turpentine.</b>&mdash;Turpentine is the base of
most liniments, and it has some value, but
mustard plasters are safer. Turpentine is inflammable,
and never should be applied near
an open fire. Turpentine should not be given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
internally, unless prescribed by a physician.</p>


<p><b>Whisky.</b>&mdash;Whisky, brandy, wine, and all
other spirits should be used sparingly. They
are likely to do more harm than good. Hot
water, hot coffee, hot tea, or aromatic spirits
of ammonia are to be preferred. Children
should never be given spirituous liquids, except
in extreme cases, and then only 10 to 20
drops in water.</p>


<p><b>Witch Hazel or Hamamelis.</b>&mdash;Used as a
remedy for sprains, wounds, and swelling. It
is a mild application for chapped hands, and
used by the laity for burns, scalds, cuts, etc.
It is not irritating, and is a good substitute
for arnica. Its use externally is absolutely
safe.</p>


<p><b>Vaseline.</b>&mdash;It is to be recommended for
burns, scalds, etc. It is nonirritating and is
not poisonous. It can be used frequently.</p>


<p><b>Cold Cream.</b>&mdash;A perfectly safe article to be
used for chapped hands and lips, and skin
roughness.</p>


<p><b>Emetics and Stimulants.</b>&mdash;In practically all
cases, and where poison has entered the stomach,
it is well to empty the stomach immediately.
If a stomach pump cannot be procured,
an emetic should be administered. Doctors
would administer ipecac, apomorphine, sulphate
of zinc, tartar emetic, and other drugs,
but none of them are likely to be available<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
before the physician arrives. When notifying
the physician tell him, if possible, the kind of
poison taken, so he may be prepared. A dessert-spoonful
of ground dry mustard in a glass
of warm water is likely to produce vomiting.
Follow the first dose with a second one.
Then push the forefinger down the throat as
far as possible, that the patient may vomit.
Dissolve a teaspoonful of salt in water and
give to the patient, or administer a teaspoonful
of ipecac every few minutes to a child, and
a tablespoonful to an adult. Follow the dose
with a glass of water and then insert the forefinger
in the throat. One who has taken
opium does not vomit easily and strenuous
efforts should be made to produce vomiting.
If one emetic does not work, give another,
and keep on repeating it.</p>


<p class="ph3">Exercise</p>

<p>Physical exercises are absolutely essential
to health. The working man, however, is
likely to obtain enough of it from his daily
action, but those of sedentary habits, especially
those who work indoors, will not receive
sufficient exercise from their labor.</p>

<p>While the gymnasium is to be recommended,
and while it has done much to make
weak people strong, I would not advise any
one to take more than very simple gymnasium
exercises without the advice of a physi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>cian.
Exercises may be taken in the bedroom,
with the use of light dumb bells, or
without the use of any apparatus at all.</p>

<p>Walking is the best of all, for it can be
enjoyed by those in poor health or physically
weak. It takes one out of doors, and exercise
out of doors is far better than that taken in a
closed room. If you exercise at home, open
all of the windows.</p>

<p>Every one should walk at least two miles a
day in the open air, unless he is very weak.
Select a companion, as exercise is more efficacious
if enjoyed and is not mere exercise by
itself. Take long breaths in the open air every
morning. Overexercise, and much of that
practiced by athletes, injure the heart and
work opposite from the intention. No strenuous
exercise should be taken after mid-life
without the advice of a physician. Any good
doctor will prescribe a course of exercises for
you at a nominal fee, most of them not charging
more than a dollar for advice. Then,
those who exercise need more food and a different
kind of food from that required by
those who do not exercise.</p>

<p>As cases differ, it is inadvisable for me to
prescribe proper food. Consult your physician.</p>


<p><b>Extinguishing Fires from Coal Oil.</b>&mdash;Do
not attempt to smother the flame by water.
Smother it with a carpet or cloth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>


<p class="ph3">Fainting</p>

<p>Ordinary fainting is distinct from that
which occurs from shock or collapse, the
latter following serious injuries, while fainting
is common with some people, and may
not be serious.</p>

<p>Those who are subject to frequent fainting
spells should consult a physician that he may
locate the cause.</p>

<p>If fainting is caused from any disease of the
heart, or from a weak heart, death may follow,
and such persons should be under the
care of a physician.</p>

<p>When fainting occurs, place the patient on
his back with his head as low or lower than
the body. Raise the legs. He should have
plenty of fresh air. If fainting occurs in a
crowd, ask the spectators to move away. If
in-doors, open all doors and windows, loosen
the clothing, and sprinkle water upon the face,
at the same time applying smelling salts or
spirits of camphor held close to the nose, but
not touching it. The body may be rubbed
to assist the circulation. If the person does
not quickly revive, apply gentle heat or a
mustard plaster to the pit of the stomach.
When he recovers give him hot tea or coffee,
and never more than a moderate amount of
alcoholic stimulants. Keep him in a reclining
position for some time after he has recovered.</p>


<p><b>Feeding an Invalid.</b>&mdash;If the illness is at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
serious, consult a physician. He will tell you
what and what not to give the patient in the
way of food. Never cook the food in the
presence of the invalid, and keep the smell of
cooking away from him. Don't eat in his
presence, as it may annoy him. Serve everything
attractively, with spotless napkin, table
cloth, and ware. Be careful not to spill anything.
Hot articles should be served very hot,
and cold ones very cold, as lukewarm viands
are not acceptable. Everything brought into
the sick-room should be covered with dishes
or napkins. Better bring in too little than too
much, more to be served if the patient desires
it.</p>


<p><b>Fire in the House.</b>&mdash;When the house is afire
cover the head, if possible, with a wet cloth,
or dry one if there is no facility for wetting
it, cutting holes for the eyes. Creep on the
floor and don't stand up or walk, for the air
is clearer next to the floor, as smoke rises.
Unless there are plenty of exits, a knotted
rope should be attached to a staple. It is
easier to climb down a knotted rope than one
which is smooth. If necessary to jump from
an upper story, throw out a mattress or something
else which is soft, and attempt to land
upon it. When at a hotel or boarding house,
ascertain the means of exit before retiring.</p>


<p><b>Fits.</b>&mdash;Generally speaking, the treatment
should be similar to that given to one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
has fainted. If the patient is hysterical, apply
mustard plasters or ice to the soles of his feet
and the wrists, but do not dash water in the
face or use strong emetics or heroic measures.
If the fit is caused by epilepsy (in this case
the person is rigid), do not attempt to stop
the patient from struggling. Lay him on his
back with his head somewhat raised, and
loosen his clothing. If necessary, hold his
arms and legs gently, but do not use force.
Place a stick or knife handle between the
teeth to prevent biting the tongue. Always
summon a physician.</p>


<p><b>Frost Bite.</b>&mdash;Never place the patient near
a fire. Undress him carefully and pack frozen
parts with cloths wet with ice water. Rub
adjacent parts vigorously. Administer hot
coffee or tea. If breathing appears to have
stopped, treat him as you would one apparently
drowned. When the patient begins to
revive, place him in a warm, but not a hot,
room, cover him with blankets, and rub him
with a cloth wrung out of hot water; give
him the ordinary stimulants, but not alcoholic
ones.</p>


<p><b>Fumigating a Sick-Room.</b>&mdash;Formalin is
probably the best fumigator. Place the articles
to be fumigated in a closed room, and
pour formaldehyde over towels or bed linen
and place on the floor. The room should remain
closed for 24 hours. A room containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
100 square feet of floor surface requires at
least a pint of formaldehyde.</p>


<p class="ph3">Getting Things into the Eye, Nose, Ear, etc.</p>


<p><b>Eye.</b>&mdash;Sometimes complications result of a
most serious nature. A physician should be
sent for immediately. In the interval the following
directions may be followed: Articles
like cinders, dust, and other small objects may
be removed from the eye, if one has a steady
hand; but the eye should not be rubbed, and
should be kept closed, except when one is trying
to remove the foreign substance. The
tears by themselves will often wash out ordinary
dust or cinders. If the substance is hidden
from view, one or two grains of whole
flaxseed may remove it. Catch the upper lid
by the lashes and pull away from the eyeball
over the lower lid, holding it there for a moment,
and request the patient to blow his nose
vigorously. Visible articles may be removed
with a piece of gauze on the hand, or an absolutely
clean cloth; but don't touch the eye
with the finger. As the eye is a very delicate
organ, the novice should not attempt to operate
upon it.</p>


<p><b>Nose.</b>&mdash;Blow the nose very hard, and close
one side of the nostril by pressing your finger
against it. Tickle the nose or give snuff to
excite sneezing. Sometimes the article will be
removed if the patient takes a long breath and
closes his mouth, then give him a sharp blow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
on the back. If the body is not discharged,
call a physician.</p>


<p><b>Ear.</b>&mdash;There is great danger in tampering
with the ear. Never insert needles or pins in
an attempt to remove foreign substances.
Better send for a physician. If live insects
enter the ear, pour a small quantity of sweet
oil or glycerin into the ear and very gently
syringe it with warm water.</p>


<p><b>Throat.</b>&mdash;Send for a physician immediately,
and tell him what you think the matter is,
so he may bring the necessary instruments.
If there is no difficulty in breathing, wait for
the physician. Slap the person on the back
when the body is bent forward with face
downwards, which will cause him to cough.
Elevate him so that his head is lower than
his body and slap him on the back while in
this position.</p>


<p><b>Getting Wet.</b>&mdash;Many colds are contracted
on account of exposure to rain and moisture.
Unless able to change your clothes, keep
moving. It is said that very few colds are
contracted while one is exercising.</p>


<p><b>Headaches.</b>&mdash;Under no circumstances take
a headache powder, or any drug whatsoever,
without the advice of your physician. Many
headache powders contain dangerous drugs,
which work upon the heart, sometimes causing
death. Headaches almost invariably come
from a cause not located in the head itself.
Do not attempt to cure it yourself. The head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>ache
powder may relieve the headache temporarily
at the expense of the system.</p>


<p><b>Hiccoughs.</b>&mdash;Drink a glass full of cold
water as rapidly as possible. Breathe deeply.
If the hiccoughs continue, call a physician.</p>


<p class="ph3">How to Avoid Accidents</p>

<p>Never cross the street without looking both
ways.</p>

<p>Do not get off of a car or other vehicle
while it is in motion.</p>

<p>Never thrust your head or arms out of the
car or other vehicle.</p>

<p>When it is lightning, avoid trees and metallic
articles.</p>

<p>Never allow firearms to be lying about.
Have some one place for them and be sure
that no one can get at them.</p>

<p>Move quickly when it is cold; and when
any part is frozen, do not go near the fire,
but rub with snow.</p>

<p>Always change wet clothing as soon as possible,
and keep moving until you have opportunity
to change.</p>

<p>Never walk on a railroad track.</p>

<p>Do not light a fire with kerosene or other
inflammable fluid.</p>

<p>Never enter a cellar or anywhere else where
gas is escaping with a light in your hand.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances touch a wire hanging
in the street.</p>

<p>Maintain a medicine chest containing all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the common remedies, but don't select them
without the advice of your physician. Mark
each bottle plainly, with directions under the
label.</p>

<p>Never take medicine without looking at the
label beforehand.</p>


<p><b>Illuminating Gas.</b>&mdash;Summon a physician,
and before he arrives proceed as follows:
Remove the patient into fresh air and walk
him around. Place his arms about your
shoulders, and if there are two rescuers place
one arm around the shoulders of each. A
glass of Weiss beer should be given while the
patient is walking, as it removes gas from the
stomach. In five minutes give half a teaspoonful
of aromatic spirits of ammonia in a
third of a glass of water. Repeat this dose
every 15 minutes until four doses have been
given. The neck of the beer bottle may be
forced into the patient's mouth.</p>


<p><b>Infectious Diseases.</b>&mdash;It is now generally
supposed that all contagious and communicable
diseases are contracted by the germs which
pass into the body or system. These germs
are so small that millions of them may enter
the body through the nose, throat, and skin.
They do little or no harm to a healthy person,
for the healthy body is opposed to their
growth, but if one is weak, or suffering from
a slight cold, or is depressed, they may multiply
and cause diseases. These germs may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
be widely scattered,&mdash;in the clothes, bedding,
carpets, and in the hair and skin. They cling
to walls and ceilings and they will multiply
on almost any kind of food. No one can
wholly prevent coming into contact with
them, but he can, if he will, avoid most of
the contagious diseases by never sitting down
in the sick-room, especially avoiding the bed,
and keeping away from the walls and furniture.
He should wash his hands with antiseptic
soap after handling the patient. Exercise
regularly in the open air. Nurses should
wear washable dresses, which are frequently
changed and a washable cap should cover
their hair. When in the sick-room do not
approach the patient near enough to catch his
breath. Do not touch with your lips any
food, dish, or utensil which has been in the
sick-room. Do not eat or drink in the sick-room.
Wear no clothing that the patient wore
before being taken sick. Never touch the sick
person if your hands are sore or scratched, and
be sure to wash them after contact with him.
Never allow the dishes used by the patient to
be used by any other unless they are very carefully
washed and scalded in boiling water. All
articles of food not eaten by the patient
should be burned, and milk and food should
never be allowed to stand in the sick-room.
All bodily discharges should be immediately
removed and covered with disinfecting solution,
and the vessels should be washed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
antiseptics before being brought back into the
room.</p>


<p><b>Lockjaw.</b>&mdash;Do not attempt to cure it. Consult
your physician. It will probably be fatal.</p>


<p><b>Mustard Plasters.</b>&mdash;Plasters occasionally are
efficacious, but most give more apparent than
real relief. They should not be used indiscriminately
or without the advice of a physician.</p>


<p><b>Neuralgia.</b>&mdash;This is often incurable, but may
be relieved. Certain liniments are efficacious,
but are not to be recommended indiscriminately.
Better consult your physician.</p>


<p class="ph3">Poison</p>

<p>Poisons taken into the system through the
mouth, and not through the blood, require a
different treatment.</p>

<p>Poisons may be classified as follows: 1.
Irritant, in which the symptoms appear entirely
at the location of the poison. 2. Systemic,
in which the poison affects the system
at large in addition to producing local
irritation. 3. Narcotic or sleep-producing.
4. General, in which there is no local irritation.</p>

<p>In the first mentioned, it is best not to
cause vomiting. Give dilute acids to neutralize
alkalis, and dilute alkalis to neutralize
acids. Then administer oil, raw egg, or flour
and water. Small doses of opiates may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
given to quiet the pain, and whisky or other
spirituous liquor to relieve weakness.</p>

<p>In the second class (except for arsenic or
similar poisoning) no emetic should be given.
The poison may be counteracted by bland
doses of oil, flour, and water, white of eggs;
and stimulating drinks should be given to
counteract depression.</p>

<p>In the third class, make strenuous effort to
produce vomiting, then give strong coffee or
other stimulating drinks, and make every effort
to keep the patient awake, even if you
have to keep him walking.</p>

<p>Fourth class. Give emetics, and follow with
stimulating drinks to relieve weakness and
pain. The patient should be allowed to rest.</p>


<p class="ph3">Poisoning.</p>


<p><b>Poisoning by Acids.</b>&mdash;For sulphuric, muriatic,
nitric, and acetic acids give immediately
a solution of baking soda or magnesia, chalk,
lime, soap-suds, or chalk tooth powder, followed
by raw eggs, milk, or sweet oil.</p>


<p><b>For Carbolic Acid or Creosote.</b>&mdash;Give alcohol
and, immediately, castor oil, sweet oil, raw
eggs, or milk, followed by an emetic.</p>


<p><b>For Oxalic Acid.</b>&mdash;Administer lime, chalk,
or magnesia. Lime may be scraped from the
wall or ceiling and dissolved in water, but
don't use soda, potash, or ammonia.</p>


<p><b>For Prussic Acid.</b>&mdash;Generally the patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
dies immediately, but if he is still living, do
not stop to give emetics, but administer stimulants.
Apply hot and cold douches and use
artificial respiration.</p>


<p><b>For Aconite Poisoning.</b>&mdash;Wash the stomach
with a stomach tube and avoid emetics. Use
stimulants. Apply warmth to the extremities
and place mustard plasters over the heart and
legs. If the patient is insensible, use artificial
respiration.</p>


<p><b>For Camphor.</b>&mdash;Give emetics, oils, and eggs.
Apply warmth to the extremities.</p>


<p><b>For Chloroform.</b>&mdash;If caused by inhalation,
resort to artificial respiration and apply friction.
Place the patient in the fresh air, keeping
the head very low. Alternate hot and cold
applications. If it occurs from internal use,
administer large doses of bicarbonate of soda
in water. Administer artificial respiration if
the patient is insensible.</p>


<p><b>For Nux Vomica.</b>&mdash;Tobacco, chewing or
smoking, and animal charcoal, dissolved in
water. Follow with emetics. Use artificial
respiration when necessary.</p>


<p><b>For Opium.</b>&mdash;Administer an emetic, such as
mustard or ipecac. Apply water to the head,
face, and spine. Give strong coffee, but do
not give alcoholic stimulants. Keep the patient
aroused by walking, whipping, or other
means. Use artificial respiration if necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>


<p><b>For Arsenic.</b>&mdash;Give emetics immediately, including
draughts of hot, greasy water or salt
and water. Administer in large doses magnesia
or lime scraped from the walls or ceilings.
Give castor oil, sweet oil, or equal parts
of sweet oil and lime water, or raw eggs.
Use stimulants well diluted.</p>


<p><b>For Corrosive Sublimate.</b>&mdash;Administer an
emetic and large doses of white of eggs, milk,
mucilage, barley water, or flour and water.
Force the patient to swallow large quantities.
Use the stomach pump.</p>


<p><b>For Belladonna.</b>&mdash;Give emetics and stimulants.
Apply warmth to extremities and mustard
plasters to the feet. Use artificial respiration
if necessary.</p>


<p><b>For Poisonous Mushrooms.</b>&mdash;Give emetics,
castor oil, stimulants, and apply heat.</p>


<p><b>Pulse.</b>&mdash;The average rate of the pulse in
adults is 76 beats every minute; but it varies
according to age. At birth it is from 130 to
140; 1st year, 115 to 130; 2d year, 100 to 115;
3d year, 95 to 105; between 7 and 14, 80 to
90; between 14 and 21, 75 to 80; between 21
and 60, 70 to 75; in old age, from 75 to 80.
The female pulse is from 10 to 15 beats
quicker than that of the male of the same
age. To count the pulse, place the finger
over the artery at the wrist; count the beats
for 15 seconds, multiply this by four, and the
result is the number of beats a minute. Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
not use the thumb, as there is a sort of pulse
in it which interferes with counting.</p>


<p><b>Rheumatism.</b>&mdash;So far as is known, there is
no certain cure for rheumatism, notwithstanding
the many nostrums that are advertised as
sure cures. Rheumatism may be helped by
avoiding meat and other nitrogenous foods,
confining the diet to vegetables and similar
foods, and drinking water freely. Rheumatism,
however, is too serious to be treated by
other than a physician.</p>


<p class="ph3">Scalds and Burns</p>

<p>Place the patient in a comfortable and safe
place and remove the clothing rapidly with a
knife or scissors. If it sticks, cut away as
much as is necessary, but don't pull it off.
Clothing may sometimes be removed by
sprinkling with water or oil. Do not expose
the surface of the burn or scald to the air.
Cover as quickly as possible with flour or
vaseline and wrap a cloth about it wet with
a solution of water and common baking soda.</p>

<p>If the clothing is afire, force the person to
lie down immediately, wrap him in a blanket
or other piece of cloth, preferably of woolen.
Do not allow him to run around or expose
himself to a draught. Fire may be extinguished
by slapping the burning parts with a
cloth, or throwing water upon the person, but
the wrapping process is better, because it im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>mediately
smothers the fire, and water is not
always available.</p>

<p>Slight scalds or burns may be relieved by
the application of a solution made of a pint
of water with one teaspoonful of baking soda
or saleratus. Apply with a piece of lint, and
then cover the burn or scald with absorbent
cotton, held in place by a bandage. If the
burn or scald is severe, apply sweet oil, olive
oil, vaseline, or the white of an egg. If these
are not handy, cover the spot with starch or
use damp earth.</p>

<p>Burns caused by lye, and other alkaline
chemicals, should be covered with water, then
with vinegar, and then treated as those by
fire.</p>

<p>Burns caused by acids and vitrol should be
soaked with water and thoroughly washed
with soda (saleratus) or lime water. Chalk
or tooth powder may be used when saleratus
is not available.</p>

<p>Carbolic acid burns may be treated with
strong alcohol.</p>

<p>Burns of the mouth or throat coming from
the drinking of hot fluids, may be treated by
taking oil or the white of an egg into the
mouth and allowing it to run into the throat
if the throat is affected. Vinegar should be
used for burns in the mouth coming from
caustic potash and ammonia. If the burn is
serious, summon the doctor.</p>

<p>Burns caused by gunpowder should be
treated the same as are ordinary burns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>


<p class="ph3">Shock or Collapse</p>

<p>Shock or collapse frequently occurs after serious
accidents. It can be foretold generally,
because the skin is cool and clammy, and it
is usually accompanied with vomiting or
rapid pulse, irregular breathing, or sighing,
and the eyelids may be heavy, the pupils dilated,
and the mind is not active. Insensibility
frequently accompanies a shock. Send
for a surgeon or doctor immediately. Place
the patient in a warm bed, if possible, cover
him with blankets, and allow his head to lie
low. Remove all clothing, cutting it to save
time. Wrap bandages around wounds or
broken bones.</p>

<p>Hot cloths, or hot water bags, or a hot
brick wrapped in cloth should be applied to
the region of the heart, the pit of the stomach,
and the feet. If wet cloths are used, wring
them out frequently in hot water and re-apply
them. It is not necessary to use heat sufficient
to burn the skin. Under no circumstances
apply heat to the head.</p>

<p>If possible, force the patient to drink hot
water, hot tea, hot coffee, or hot milk. Malted
milk is excellent, but it should be hot.
Whisky and other alcoholic liquor should not
be given, except by the advice of a doctor.
Half a teaspoonful of aromatic spirits of ammonia
in water may be given every 15 minutes
for four doses, but not more. Stimu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>lants
should not be given after the patient
begins to recover.</p>

<p>Vomiting may be stopped or relieved by
administering a little brandy mixed with
cracked ice.</p>

<p>If the skull is injured or there is concussion
of the brain, with or without the appearance
of apoplexy or severe breathing, do not administer
a stimulant.</p>


<p><b>Sleeplessness.</b>&mdash;Insomnia rapidly lowers the
vital forces. It is due to several causes, including
mental worry, indigestion, physical
overexercise, and functional or organic diseases.
Insomnia may be considered a natural
warning of coming ailment. The cause should
be located, and a good physician should be
consulted. Sleep is encouraged by exercise in
the open air and by taking hot drinks just
before retiring. Hot malted milk is excellent;
but solid food should not be taken just before
retiring. Mild gymnastic exercise may be
taken before an open window, but drugs
should never be administered without the
advice of a physician.</p>


<p><b>Snake Bite.</b>&mdash;Do not waste valuable time to
kill the snake. If the bite is venomous, rip
open the clothing so that the wound will be
exposed. Tie a handkerchief or rope around
the arm or leg, above the bite. It should be
drawn so tight that the circulation will be
stopped or retarded. The use of a stick or
pencil will assist in giving pressure. With a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
knife, open the holes made by the snake's
fangs and cut around the wound liberally,
being careful not to sever an artery. Let the
blood run freely. Poison is sometimes removed
by sucking a wound, but one should
not do this if his lips are chapped or bleeding.
The wound should be washed with soda solution
and large doses of whisky or brandy
should be administered. Call a surgeon immediately.</p>


<p><b>Sore Throat.</b>&mdash;Sore throat may be merely
local or be a forerunner of diphtheria. Better
consult a physician.</p>


<p><b>Sprains.</b>&mdash;Most sprains are serious, and a
doctor should be called at once, but before
he arrives the following simple treatment may
be applied. Sprains twist and tear the ligaments
and may rupture the small blood vessels.
The flow of blood may be checked by
application of cold or heat or by pressure.
If the ankle or foot is sprained, wrap a folded
towel tightly around the part sprained and
then apply moist heat and elevate the leg.
Immerse the foot in water as hot as can be
borne and keep on adding hot water for about
20 minutes, so that the temperature may not
be lowered; then apply a bandage, but continue
the bathing treatment. Cold applications
may be used instead of hot water, and
should be applied by dipping cloths in ice
water frequently, and wrapping them about
the parts injured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>


<p><b>Stings of Poisonous Insects</b> or of scorpions,
centipedes, etc., should be treated with hartshorn,
ammonia, after which cold water or
cracked ice should be applied. Do not fail to
call a surgeon or doctor. If the sting remains
in the wound, remove it either by pressure
on the skin or with a knife. The stings of
common insects, such as mosquitoes, ants,
etc., should be treated with a weak solution
of ammonia, salt water, or a cloth wet with
water in which a teaspoonful of baking soda
to a pint of water is dissolved, may be bound
on it.</p>


<p><b>Suffocation.</b>&mdash;Always summon a physician.
Place the patient in the air, remove all tight
clothing about the neck and chest, and apply
artificial respiration. Apply hot water in bottles
to the body. Put mustard plasters above
the heart, on the soles of his feet, and on his
wrists. When the patient shows signs of recovering,
give mild stimulants. If the patient
is in a close room, open the windows and all
of the doors. In rescue work do not open
windows, but smash out all of the glass. In
entering a room full of smoke, cover the
mouth with a handkerchief wet with water or
vinegar and water. Crawl on the floor, as
the smoke is less dense near the floor. The
rescuer should attach a rope to himself, so he
can be pulled from his dangerous position.</p>


<p><b>Sunstroke.</b>&mdash;Indications of sunstroke or heat
prostration are a slow but full pulse, very la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>bored
breathing, and the skin is hot and dry,
the face usually red, and the person affected
is unconscious. Remove the sufferer to a
shady place, and be sure to loosen his collar
and clothing, if tight. Raise the head and
shoulders. The head, face, and chest should
be drenched with cold water, and if it is very
hot use cracked ice. In ordinary cases of
heat prostration, the patient is not unconscious,
the skin is pale and clammy, and the
breathing is not normal. Force the patient to
lie on his back with his head level with his
body, and loosen all tight clothing. Apply
heat to the extremities, and cold to head. The
patient should not be allowed to drink too
much water. Give him hot drinks, and apply
heat to the spine and feet. Under no circumstances
administer alcoholic stimulants. Always
send for a physician.</p>


<p><b>Temperature of the Body.</b>&mdash;The normal
body temperature is 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
When it is higher, the patient is supposed to
have a fever. Temperature usually rises in
the afternoon, being one degree higher than in
the first part of the night or in the early
morning. It gradually falls from midnight to
six or seven o'clock in the morning. The
temperature of a child frequently rises two
degrees from slight causes. Every family
should carry a clinical thermometer. Bodily
temperature should be taken by holding it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the mouth under the tongue for two minutes.
Temperature under 101° indicates a slight
fever; under 103° a moderate fever; under
105° a high fever. When the temperature
rises two or three degrees above normal, send
for a doctor at once.</p>


<p><b>Temperature of the Sick-Room.</b>&mdash;Sixty-eight
degrees Fahrenheit is a good average
temperature for the sick-room. In certain
diseases the average temperature may be
lower, and for throat or chest affections it
should be higher. When the patient is being
washed or dressed, the temperature should be
kept at about 70°.</p>


<p><b>Toothache.</b>&mdash;If the nerve is exposed, or
nearly so, toothache may be cured by placing
in the cavity a small piece of cotton soaked
in creosote or oil of cloves. If it continues,
consult a dentist.</p>


<p><b>Transporting the Wounded.</b>&mdash;Great care
should be taken, because the slightest carelessness
is likely to cause intense suffering.
A four-handed seat may be made by two persons,
the hands of each one clasping one of
the wrists of the other, and two ordinary men
can easily carry a person of average weight.
A stretcher will carry the patient in a horizontal
position if the persons carrying it place
their hands under it. A stretcher may be
made of boards, over which are placed coats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
or shawls, or a blanket may be fastened to
two stout poles; if no poles are handy, a shawl
tightly held by two persons will do, but great
care should be taken to keep it tight. A window
shutter is generally available. The sufferer
should be very carefully placed upon the
stretcher, and had better be lifted by several
persons, by two at least. The bearers of the
stretcher should not keep step, the opposite
feet should be put forward at the same time
to prevent the swaying of the stretcher and
the rolling of the patient. Never carry the
stretcher on the shoulders. Carry the patient
feet foremost, except when going up hill. In
case of a fractured thigh or leg, carry the
patient head first when going down hill.</p>


<p><b>Ventilation.</b>&mdash;The sick-room should never
be without fresh air. Impure and close air
breeds disease and encourages illness. Fresh
air should be introduced constantly and
steadily. The windows may be lowered at
the top or patented ventilators used. To
change the air, open the windows in an adjoining
room, and then open the door between
the rooms, but the fresh air in the adjoining
room should be warm before it is allowed to
penetrate the sick-room. By swinging the
door back and forth, the air will be fanned
in. Do not maintain the erroneous impression
that cold air is pure because it is cold,
for cold air may be as foul as warm air.
Night air is not dangerous. The patient must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
breathe night air or closed-in day air, and
closed-in air rapidly becomes foul.</p>


<p><b>Vomiting.</b>&mdash;Lie down and hold small pieces
of ice in your mouth. If it continues, consult
a physician.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p><b>Wills.</b>&mdash;A will, untechnically speaking, is
virtually a bill-of-sale or transfer of property
by its owner to those he may designate, but
differs from the ordinary bill-of-sale in that
there is no consideration mentioned on the
part of those who will receive the property,
and the will is not operative until the death of
the maker of it. No one can execute a will
unless he is presumably in his right mind, and
knows what he is doing. Nor can a will be
made by an idiot or one insane. The will
must be signed and witnessed by several witnesses,
each witness signing as a witness in
the presence of all of the other witnesses.
While it would appear that every one has a
right to dispose of his property as he chooses,
a will is not likely to stand in law if it can
be proved that the maker of it was under undue
or unfair influence, and, therefore, distributed
his property to the prejudice of those
who would be entitled to it if no will was
made. For example: a will is not likely to hold
good if its maker unfairly disowned close legal
heirs, like a wife, husband, or children, or bequeathed
his property to some institution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
which it could be shown he probably would
not have done had not unfair pressure been
brought to bear upon him at the time he made
his will. All legal heirs should, as a rule, be
mentioned in a will, even though they are
given insignificant sums. As the laws differ
in the several states, it is suggested that it is
better and safer to consult a good lawyer,
or one familiar with conditions.</p>


<p><b>Wireless Telegraphy.</b>&mdash;The exact date of
the discovery or invention of wireless telegraphy
is not accurately known. Many scientists
discovered it theoretically before Marconi
made it practical. Some scientific authorities
claim that it was originated by Professor
Dolbear, of Massachusetts. In 1899,
messages were sent from England to France,
and recently an intelligible message was
flashed across the Atlantic Ocean. Unscientifically
speaking, wireless telegraphy consists
of discharging powerful electrical currents
into the atmosphere, their vibrations being
taken up by the natural electricity in the air,
and received by wires placed at an elevation.
Practically all sea-going steamers are equipped
with wireless telegraphy.</p>


<p><b>Woman's Suffrage.</b>&mdash;The first convention
in the interest of woman's rights was held July
19, 1808, at Seneca Falls, N. Y. In 1850, a
National Woman's Rights Convention was
held in Worcester, Mass. From that time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
woman's suffrage was agitated in America and
in England, and many of the leading women
of the world strongly advocated it. It is
growing rapidly, and is being recognized
throughout the country, although all of the
States have not given the vote to women.
Under the Constitution of the United States
a native-born woman may hold any office, including
that of president, even though the
women in all of the States cannot vote at the
presidential election. The Constitution of the
United States does not recognize sex, and in
the eye of national law, women have all of the
rights of men.</p>


<p><b>Women Voters.</b>&mdash;Many of the towns, cities,
and States give full franchise to women, while
others allow them to vote for only a few officials.
Woman's suffrage, or the right to vote,
is spreading rapidly, and it is probably only
a question of time before she will have full
franchise throughout the entire country. There
is nothing in the Constitution of the United
States to prevent a woman from holding the
office of president or vice-president if she was
born in this country, and she can hold such
offices even though she may not be permitted
by State law to vote for them.</p>

<p><b>Wool Industry.</b>&mdash;The United States produces
about $320,000,000 worth of wool in a
year and weaves about 55,500,000 square
yards, worth about $40,500,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>


<p><b>World's Largest Steamships.</b>&mdash;The "Imperator,"
just placed in commission, is the
world's largest vessel. She is 919 feet long,
98 feet beam, and 62 feet deep. The boat
deck is 100 feet, and the trunks of the mast
246 feet, above the keel. The funnels are 69
feet long with oval openings, 29 by 18 feet.
The rudder alone weighs 90 tons. She is
registered at 50,000 tons, with a displacement
of 70,000 tons. Displacement represents the
weight of the water which is occupied by that
part of the hull under water. The ship is a
modern floating hotel, containing a grill-room,
a tea garden, a veranda café, several ladies'
sitting-rooms, a palm garden, a ball-room, a
gymnasium, a swimming tank, and other accessories.
In the first cabin there are 220
regular bath rooms and showers, including 150
private bath rooms. The staterooms do not
contain berths, metal bedsteads being used
throughout. The entrance hall is 90 feet wide,
and 69 feet long. In addition the vessel carries
a drug store, a book store, and a flower shop,
and several passenger elevators are maintained.
To illuminate the ship there are 9,500
electric lamps. The Roman bath is 65 feet
long, and 41 feet wide. The swimming bath
is 39 feet long, 21 feet wide, and 9 feet deep.
The quadruple turbine engines have 72,000
horse-power and develop an average speed of
22-1/2 knots an hour. One of the immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
rotars contains 50,000 blades, and weighs 135
tons. The ship carries a crew of 1,100 persons,
a complete fire department, and wireless
telegraphy. If the "Imperator" was set on
end, she would be higher than the largest
building in the world, which is 750 feet high.
The ship has a passenger capacity equal to the
population of a large town.</p>


<p><b>Yankee.</b>&mdash;This word is said to be a corruption
of English or Anglais, pronounced by the
Massachusetts Indians, who gave this name
to the New England Colonists, Yenghies,
Yanghies, Yankees. It was applied to the
New Englanders by the British soldiers during
the Revolutionary War, and to the Federal
soldiers by the Confederates during the Civil
War.</p>


<p><b>Yankee Doodle.</b>&mdash;The origin of Yankee
Doodle, perhaps the most famous American
national air, is unknown. It is supposed to
have been an English tune. At any rate, it
was introduced into America by the British
troops in 1775.</p>

<p class="ph3">FIRST AIDS TO SUCCESS</p>

<p class="ph4">By Nathaniel C Fowler, Jr.</p>

<p>This book contains about a hundred articles,
which appeared in the leading newspapers of
the United States and Canada, and were read
by millions. They attracted world-wide attention,
and were acknowledged to be the best inspirational
"short talks" ever written.</p>

<p class="ph2">The Art of Speech Making</p>

<p class="ph4">By Nathaniel C. Fowler, Jr.</p>

<p>This book is intensely practical. It deals with
facts and information, not with theories. The
author analyzes every form of speech or address,
from the oration of the great statesmen to the
everyday "remarks" of after-dinner speakers and
others who address the public formally or informally.
He gets down to the very bottom of
speech-making, and gives information which has
not been printed in any book, and which cannot
be obtained in any other way.</p>

<p>Practically all the information needed by
the letter writer is given in this book, and
everything in it is in the plainest of intelligible
English. It is probably the only work of
its kind ever prepared by one who has had
both business and literary experience, and
who, therefore, has not written with professional
bias or with the prosaicalness of
unmixed business.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
